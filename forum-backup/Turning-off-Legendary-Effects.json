This placed looked like the most suitable.</p>\n<p>Can you guys add an option to turn off Legendary effects? <br>\nMeaning for example: I’ve got a guard with Rodgort. When I use Torch #4 I would like to throw the blue flame instead of a Rodgort Torch.</p>\n<p>Another example: Dragonhunter virtue F1. While equipped with Dawn, I would like to still throw a spear, not a mini Dawn towards the enemy.</p>\n<p>Anything that can be done? Maybe add an option in the “in game” menu?</p>","arenanet":false}]}
