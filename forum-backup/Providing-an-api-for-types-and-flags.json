I figured i d make this available to other people once i got it working the way i want it, because I pretty much mapped the info from the v1 item_details api to a database and, keeping normalisation rules in mind, I would have a table that maps ids to strings of types, so to speak. thus, since i didnt want to have my application check against that table for every single item because that would be awfully slow, I first did a little prototype where i mapped everything within an ENUM, and thats the point where i noticed that the documentation on types and flags wasnt really reliable since a lot of them werent documented, such as Toy, Bundle and TwohandedToy for instance.</p>\n<p>To this point, i have strayed from the ENUM idea and am currently getting the kinks worked out with ConcurrentCollections because I have 4 parallel threads firing away at the API for speed reasons.</p>\n<p>That is for the v1 api though. The v2 might be a little more handy due to it letting you grab all the info you need faster and more efficient, which will also make testing less horrible because you dont have to wait xx hours for your application to be done with assaulting the v1 items api and checking that mess for errors along the way.</p>\n<p>TL;DR : long story short, in the long run this will pretty much just be all values that are in my types and flags tables JSONified.</p>\n<p>Not sure if there is a possibility to directly feed that info into the wiki while we are at it.</p>","arenanet":false},{"pubDate":"2014-10-01T08:16:32.000Z","guid":"http://forum-en.guildwars2.com/forum/community/api/Providing-an-api-for-types-and-flags/4457838","author":"StevenL.3761","body":"\n<p>If I’m getting this right, the idea is to have a program running that periodically scans the official API for previously unknown constants.

Flags are usually something that is hardcoded into the logic at some point. So the set of flags is very limited, and static. And there’s no need to provide a “static documentation API”. Things like this should be in the API documentation.</p>\n<p>An API that would provide this kind of info would in the same way require to be updated manually whenever a new flag is introduced and that has the same problems as a documentation: People forget to update it, so the resource becomes outdated. But unlike a custom API, the documentation is very easy to fix, especially by others (e.g. us, when we notice an item with a new flag).</p>\n<blockquote><div class=\"citey\"><cite title=\"Posted on September 30 2014 07:39PM\"><a href=\"/forum/community/api/Providing-an-api-for-types-and-flags/4456463\">AysonCurrax.3254:</a></cite></div><div class=\"quotey\"><p>PS: Added the v2/items documentation to the main page of the docu since you seem to have forgotten to do that initially and it bugged me. :p</p></div></blockquote>\n<p>Yeah, I forgot to do that.
