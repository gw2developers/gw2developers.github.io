I’m not sure if there’s any interest in this, but I wanted to develop something using the GW2Spidy API and Python, however the only wrapper that I could find was for Python 2.X ( I wanted to use 3). So I updated the wrapper I found to use Python 3.X, and you can find it on my GitHub over <a href=\"https://github.com/snowspirit/pygw2spidy\">here</a>!</p>\n<p>I also included some very basic starting code so that hopefully anybody (even someone fairly new to Python) can use it! ^__^</p>","arenanet":false}]}
