Perhaps they’ll extend it to additional endpoints in the future.</p>\n<p>One way to formally ask for that kind of functionality is to just open a thread asking for that feature, along with specific examples of what you would like for it to do, how, and why. It may not get at the top of the list, but it never hurts to ask; the worst that happens is they don’t ever implement it and you’re stuck with the brute-force method of handling the data.</p>\n<p>If you would like an example, albeit a non-definitive one, on how someone might submit a feature request with enough meat for the developers to at least chew on, take a look at my thread:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://forum-en.guildwars2.com/forum/community/api/FEATURE-REQUEST-API-Query-Search-Enh/first\">https://forum-en.guildwars2.com/forum/community/api/FEATURE-REQUEST-API-Query-Search-Enh/first</a></p>\n<p>For now, keep using the brute-force method; implementing new API features is probably very low priority on their list at the moment due to the imminent HotS release. However, if you document what you’re looking for, they can at least have something to put on their project plans for the next few quarters if and when they get cycles.</p>","arenanet":false},{"pubDate":"2015-04-26T22:03:19.000Z","guid":"http://forum-en.guildwars2.com/forum/community/api/Filter-items-results-by-type/5009063","author":"Eearslya.6309","body":"\n<blockquote><div class=\"citey\"><cite title=\"Posted on April 25 2015 12:50PM\"><a href=\"/forum/community/api/Filter-items-results-by-type/5003935\">Alpha.6913:</a></cite></div><div class=\"quotey\"><blockquote><div class=\"citey\"><cite title=\"Posted on April 23 2015 05:08PM\"><a href=\"/forum/community/api/Filter-items-results-by-type/4996577\">Lawton Campbell.8517:</a></cite></div><div class=\"quotey\"><blockquote><div class=\"citey\"><cite title=\"Posted on April 23 2015 11:47AM\"><a href=\"/forum/community/api/Filter-items-results-by-type/4995325\">Silot.2593:</a></cite></div><div class=\"quotey\"><p>So is Arenanet OK for us to request 69645 items one by one to find the type we want?</p></div></blockquote>\n<p>Should be fine, though you’ll spend less time if you request whole pages, e.g., enumerate starting from /v2/items?page=0&amp;page_size=200 and look at the response headers (e.g., X-Page-Total) to see how many pages there are.</p>\n<p>This will currently take you ~206 requests, which is a lot, but shouldn’t be more than a minute or two to pull down and ingest into e.g., a database.</p></div></blockquote>\n<p>Sorry for your database haha but what I used 200 java threads to pull the data.
