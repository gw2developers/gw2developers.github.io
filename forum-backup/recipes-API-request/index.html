<p>You get the name with API:2/items and “output_item_id”.<br>
In your case:<br>
<a href="https://api.guildwars2.com/v2/items/46742">https://api.guildwars2.com/v2/items/46742</a> that returns “Lump of Mithrillium”.</p></p>

<p>I know this.<br>
Also this is the name of the end result of using the recipe. (not the recipe item name)<br>
Also I know its not much of a problem, I could add the word "Recipe: " to it.</p>
<p>But it was a Request, not an issue.</p>
<p>I wanted to keep the number of send/receive to a minimum.</p>
<p>As it is, to get what I want (Create a list of Recipe’s I Have) I would have to:</p>
<p>1. Get ID’s of recipes I have. (v2/account/recipes)</p>
<p>2. <del>Create a coma separated string of ID’s and get the Recipe info. (v2/recipes?ids=string of ids)</del> that didn’t work so:<br>
for next loop for each ID (v2/recipes/id)<br>
<strong>a lot of send/receive</strong></p>
<p>3. Now to create a list of recipes I have by name.<br>
Wait for the above to complete(2), another for next loop finding the output of each, then adding "Recipe: " to all results, the number of send/receive is adding up.</p>
<p>If the name was added to the recipe info I would be able to make my list without step 3.</p>
<p>Better still if the end point from: <strong>v2/account/recipes</strong> was <strong>id</strong> &amp; <strong>name</strong>.<br>
Then a list could be created and the recipe info would only be request on selection in the list. Saving the need to make a for next loop to download the info for all recopies at one time.</p>
<p>Could I change the request<img src="/include/images/smilies/smile.png"></p></p>

<p>
<p>I know that not all info are stored in API:2/recipes, I also explained something here <a href="/forum-backup/bad-skin-s-id">https://forum-en.guildwars2.com/forum/community/api/bad-skin-s-id</a>. So, for example, adding the name of a recipe doens’t avoid you from loading item from API:2/items if you want to show the rarity color too, but that increase the amount of data from API:2/recipes (ok a bit ;D) and you get it again from API:2/items.</p>
<p>As you have said you can add "Recipe: " to the output item name, but your example is not a recipe learned from item, so the name of auto learned recipes is exactly the output item name. What can I say now is that actually for recipes learned from item the recipe item id is missing in API:2/recipes; for auto learned recipes the recipe item does not exist.<br>
In my opinion you don’t have to add "Recipe: " and the output item name is enough.</p>
<p>Anyway you don’t have to make a loop for each id, that is ok sometimes with only few ids, but for a lot of them you have to use “v2/recipes?ids=string of ids” where <strong>“string of ids” is a comma separated string of maximum 200 ids</strong>. It is very important that your string does not go over 200 ids because it will return an error.<br>
What you have to do is a loop that create a new string of maximum 200 ids, then get those maximum 200 recipes from API:2/recipes. (It is like ?page=number of page?size=200 where 200 is maximum size of items you can get from api in a single request). After that you get all output_item_id from your list and do a similar loop with API:2/items.<br>
Even if API:2/recipes could be optimized adding all the necessary infos directly there, using “?ids=” you get all data needed in few seconds.<br>
I think that if you fix your loop at point 2. you’ll get a substantial boost.</p></p>

<p>
<p>what I would like to see returned from the recipes api is the data_id of the recipe sheet that you learn that recipe from.  <br>
for example: <a href="https://api.guildwars2.com/v2/recipes/3327">https://api.guildwars2.com/v2/recipes/3327</a><br>
this recipe makes “Pot of Artichoke Soup”<br>
you learn this recipe by consuming “Recipe: Pot of Artichoke Soup”, data_id 9798<br>
so you’d add to /recipes/3327 this text:<br>
</p><pre><code>"learned_from_id":9798</code></pre><p></p>
<p>OR<br>
an alternative would be to add to the item’s api the recipe_id the item unlocks.  so you’d add to /items/9798 the text:<br>
</p><pre><code>"teaches_recipe_id":3327</code></pre><p></p>
<p>edit:  nevermind! it’s already there!<br>
<a href="https://api.guildwars2.com/v2/items/9772">https://api.guildwars2.com/v2/items/9772</a><br>
</p><pre><code>"details":{"type":"Unlock","unlock_type":"CraftingRecipe","recipe_id":3301}</code></pre><p></p></p>

<p>Oh, thanks for the info, I did not know about the 200 limit, I suspected there might be a limit, but was not sure.</p>
<p>I still think it’s <strong>name</strong> should be included though<img src="/include/images/smilies/smile.png"><br>
