<p>The rules said it can be any App.</p>
<p>I would have tried myself but the event started since June 23 and AN just decided it was time to let us now. Between school and the lack of communication I lost all my motivation to even think about something.</p></p>

<p>Well i hope it can be any app. I plan to do a WvW app for some time now. I have a lot of collage stuff to do to. Still i might try something.</p></p>

<p>Overwolf is an app platform in itself. The apps run as overlays while you are playing, like the chat overlay on Steam. So no, you cannot develop an iOS app for this contest.</p></p>

<p>Only an Overwolf app will be accepted to the contest. We are an overlay that is present in your game and the app contest is to create apps for Guild Wars 2 using our overlay to bring said apps INTO the game.</p></p>

<p>Hi Raif, nice to have a Community Manager on board.</p>
<p>So if this must be an Overwolf related App, I cannot apply with <a href="http://gw2co.net">http://gw2co.net</a>? Because it is a WvW Overlay that supports timers and teams and is in open Beta at the moment. I can create a channel for Sanctum of Rall for example, if you like to try beyond the public Demo channel.</p>
<p>I don’t know if this App can be embedded withing Overwolf as I did not take a look at the Overwolf API, but considering it is all HTML and JS I wonder if Overwolf Apps are able use the Mumble Link Info at all. Even if this would be possible, a rewrite to Overwolf API is not doable in 2 weeks as I do go to work and GW2co.net is a hobby project. I would also need additional APIs or my server would need a rewrite to support Websockets as alternative for example.</p>
<p>So, can I apply to the contest with GW2co.net despite it is not convertable to an Overwolf App in the time left for the contest?</p>
<p>Greetings,<br>
Gil/Comes Mors</p></p>

<p>Hey GiL,</p>
<p>That is one impressive overlay there.</p>
<p>Unfortunately no, we can’t accept your (awesome) overlay as an entry. However, we’d love to see how we can help you get your program into Overwolf. If you don’t mind hit me up at my email Ari.Cashriel@Overwolf.com, maybe we can discuss what can be done to make this happen.</p>
<p>I’d love to see you enter our competition, this one and any future ones we hold for Guild Wars 2, or even just having your app on our platform. If there’s anything we can do to help you out, we’ll do it.</p></p>
