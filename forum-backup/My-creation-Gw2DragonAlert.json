It’s not much but I find it very functional as it optimizes my in game time and allows me to forget about event timers on the web. The application will do the work for you!<br>\nSo, here it is the first version of <strong>Gw2DragonAlert</strong>!<br>\nLink to download -&gt; <a href=\"http://dfiles.eu/files/dtbhq7437\">http://dfiles.eu/files/dtbhq7437</a></p>\n<p><strong>Inside the folder you will find a Readme file with some simple instuctions, please read it!</strong><br>\nThe program is very young, was made in a short time and there’s plenty of space for improvement, so feel free to give feedback and suggestions!</p>","arenanet":false}]}
