I would greatly appreciate that. I would rather avoid having to use 3rd party ones or cutting them out of screenshots myself, if i could have them easily available like that. I think they would be a great help in combination with the map service to make a full fledged live map with npc info and what not. that is actually something i am looking into at the moment. positioning them on said map wouldnt be an issue either thanks to the mumble link api, for instance.</p>","arenanet":false},{"pubDate":"2015-01-30T20:17:55.000Z","guid":"http://forum-en.guildwars2.com/forum/community/api/Are-these-available-on-the-render-service/4750106","author":"AggieTechGuy.4901","body":"\n<blockquote><div class=\"citey\"><cite title=\"Posted on January 30 2015 08:09PM\"><a href=\"/forum/community/api/Are-these-available-on-the-render-service/4750073\">Lawton Campbell.8517:</a></cite></div><div class=\"quotey\"><p>Hmm, I’ll look into getting some of those images added to the /v2/files endpoint.
