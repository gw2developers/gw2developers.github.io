The API devs have said that they want to do this, but it’s in its early stages, like, they’ve only thought of having it. That’s it. It’s probably far away on their roadmap. You have to keep in mind that instead, they’ve been very busy with the /v2 APIs. And this takes a lot of time.</p>\n<p>Instead, let me introduce you to a different, but similar feature that GW2 natively supports. It’s called AlienFX. The saddest part about it, is that it’s only for Alienware devices. So for the last half year (a little bit more), I’ve been working on and off on extending it to, for example, Logitech devices. When I started, I’ve created a video showing what it does on my Lightpack: <a href=\"https://youtu.be/nBnYySAUF88\">https://youtu.be/nBnYySAUF88</a>.</p>\n<p>It’s a pretty cool feature, but the data what GW2 sends, is only the color data for each separate light. Not the state of your game. So it’s impossible to read if a skill is off CD this way. Still, AlienFX is something fun to try out.</p>\n<p>If you’re interested, go to my repository on GitHub: <a href=\"https://github.com/Archomeda/lightfx-extender\">https://github.com/Archomeda/lightfx-extender</a>. Currently, it only extends to Logitech and Lightpack, since these are the only devices I have available. Also, it’s entirely possible that this will crash your game in one way or another. A small note: I still have to release v0.4.2 with some significant changes/fixes.</p>\n<p>If you are concerned about this plugin interfacing with GW2 and ToS, this plugin only intercepts the calls GW2 makes to Alienware’s AlienFX, does some stuff with it and forwards it to other devices. It does no such things as reading GW2’s memory.</p>\n<p>Also, now that more than 50% of my post is about advertising my project, the last thing I want to add, is that I’m actually looking for enthusiastic people willing to implement support for other devices, like Razer’s and Corsair’s.</p>","arenanet":false},{"pubDate":"2015-09-01T23:23:02.000Z","guid":"http://forum-en.guildwars2.com/forum/community/api/Corsair-K70-Question/5445020","author":"AllIsVain.6409","body":"\n<blockquote><div class=\"citey\"><cite title=\"Posted on August 31 2015 08:54PM\"><a href=\"/forum/community/api/Corsair-K70-Question/5440662\">NSKL.3174:</a></cite></div><div class=\"quotey\"><p>Any progress on this amazing project?!<br>\nI would love having a part of my K65 displaying my HP as well as the outer keys pulsing in red (as a frame) when in down-state and green / light blue when actively ressing and something similar for stomps as well.<br>\nMaybe hotkeys for skills light up in green when ready and red when on cooldown.<br>\nThis would be nothing less than amazing!<br>\nI know nothing about programming so I really hop that someone will keep working on this<img src=\"/include/images/smilies/smile.png\"></p>\n<p>Best regards!</p></div></blockquote>\n<p>I’ve looked at getting these things from the game before.

Just want to be clear on how this API works.</p>\n<p>Is there any chance this will be expanded to provide some of the data above (current hp, max hp, stamina, race?</p>","arenanet":false},{"pubDate":"2015-02-21T00:33:20.000Z","guid":"http://forum-en.guildwars2.com/forum/community/api/Corsair-K70-Question/4814997","author":"Lawton Campbell.8517","body":"\n<p>The only bit of data we currently expose is the current character’s profession. You can get this info from the super poorly-documented <a href=\"http://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Mumble\">Mumble link API</a> (see <a href=\"https://forum-en.guildwars2.com/forum/community/api/GW2-s-Mumble-Link-context-data-format/first#post4482365\">this thread</a>). Specifically, the <code>identity</code> field of the <a href=\"http://wiki.mumble.info/wiki/Link\">Link data</a> contains a JSON blob which looks like</p>\n<p>{ “name” : “character name”<br>\n, “profession” : 1<br>\n, “map_id” : 2<br>\n, “world_id” : 3<br>\n, “team_color_id” : 4<br>\n, “commander” : true<br>\n}</p>\n<p>Where “profession” has the following mapping:</p>\n<p>1 = Guardian<br>\n2 = Warrior<br>\n3 = Engineer<br>\n4 = Ranger<br>\n5 = Thief<br>\n6 = Elementalist<br>\n7 = Mesmer<br>\n8 = Necro</p>\n<p>“map_id” corresponds (or, should) to a map accessible via <a href=\"http://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/API:2/maps\">/v2/maps</a>, “world_id” to an id in <a href=\"http://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/API:2/worlds\">/v2/worlds</a>, and “team_color_id” to a color id which can be resolved against <a href=\"http://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/API:2/colors\">/v2/colors</a> (I … think).
