It can be built using Maven and comes with an TTS (Text to Speech) sample application that uses another google API to tell you by voice whats going on in WVW. By now it supports english, french, german and spanish language.</p>\n<p>Feel free to open issues if you run into any problem<img src=\"/include/images/smilies/wink.png\"></p>\n<p>At last: There is a reason, why I made my project public to find other java programmers that are interested to support me developing it much faster that i could do by my own. If you are interested, just contact me and i’ll share more information with you<img src=\"/include/images/smilies/smile.png\"></p>\n<p>greez Lul4n</p>","arenanet":false}]}
