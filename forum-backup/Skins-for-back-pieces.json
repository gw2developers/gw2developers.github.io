Everything is ok here, backpiece have skins, makes sense. However when I head over to /v2/skins and check the <a href=\"https://api.guildwars2.com/v2/skins/6809\">skin entry</a> I get the skin of “Keep Construct Mask”, which… doesn’t make sense.</p>\n<p>So is there a mix-up somewhere in these IDs, or is there something that I am missing?</p>\n<p>- Darqam</p>","arenanet":false}]}
