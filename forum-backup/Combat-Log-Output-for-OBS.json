Also I’d like to be able to show the breakdown of condition damage, IE Burning, Confusion etc.</p>\n<p>I’d also like to show the healing that’s occurring from my own self and external sources.  And my own healing on external sources, and conditions I remove from myself and external sources.</p>\n<p>It’d be wonderful if there could be a way to uniquely Identify CC skills too, even if they deal no damage, like Devourer venom.</p>\n<p>The dream is to be able to display incoming CC’s taken, condi damage, incoming auto attack damage, sigil procs, incoming damage breaking a designated threshold so I can show important hits taken (IE eviscerate, backstab, that ranger bear sword attack, etc.)</p>\n<p>There’s just a lot of noise that happens in combat, but I want a way to highlight the important things on stream, so the new viewer can consume what’s going on.</p>","arenanet":false}]}
