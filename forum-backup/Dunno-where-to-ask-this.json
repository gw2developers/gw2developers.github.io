This is done to decouple the API from the various servers it talks to so that the API can catch fire without taking down parts of the game.</p>\n<blockquote><div class=\"citey\"><cite title=\"Posted on February 17 2016 09:44PM\"><a href=\"/forum/community/api/Dunno-where-to-ask-this/5991345\">Tomiyou.3790:</a></cite></div><div class=\"quotey\"><p>One last thing.
