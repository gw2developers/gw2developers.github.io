Users should have access to info that the script already downloaded. It will be faster because you can increase the periodicity of reading the data from api and you can minimize the amount of data downloaded by each session(by just exposing the data about events users are interested). This way you minimize traffic to arenanet api and minimize the users traffic, but it will increase traffic on your server.  But overall it still would be much better if everybody follow that pattern.</p>","arenanet":false},{"pubDate":"2013-05-21T13:35:47.000Z","guid":"http://forum-en.guildwars2.com/forum/community/api/Guild-Wars-2-Meta-event-notifier/2067207","author":"Sephil.3971","body":"\n<p>Great app, thanks! :p</p>\n<p>Could you maybe make it so each world has a perma link?

But i find it a bit annoying that i get notifications about the same event every time it updates. I know i just have to untick the checkbox, but i’d like to just have it in the background, and only touch it when i get a notification. And the Fire Elemental and Frozen Maw are missing. Adding those would make it more useful for me, as they’re the ones i do the most! But other than that it’s very useful!
