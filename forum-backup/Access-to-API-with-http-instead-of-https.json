I think this should solve your issues. In case you don’t want to implement any new functions you could use the dll I’ve already created to handle https for my haskell functions. You can get the dll from the <a href=\"http://gw2apicpp.codeplex.com/\">GW2API C/C++ </a>project. If this doesn’t help either i would suggest to write your own tls dll which handles the tls handshake and communication.</p>","arenanet":false},{"pubDate":"2013-06-13T12:32:00.000Z","guid":"http://forum-en.guildwars2.com/forum/community/api/Access-to-API-with-http-instead-of-https/2205972","author":"Healix.5819","body":"\n<p>You will need to manually install the certificate.</p>","arenanet":false},{"pubDate":"2013-06-13T12:15:25.000Z","guid":"http://forum-en.guildwars2.com/forum/community/api/Access-to-API-with-http-instead-of-https/2205896","author":"zeeZ.5713","body":"\n<p>No.</p>\n<p>See <a href=\"https://forum-en.guildwars2.com/forum/community/api/HTTP-access/first#post2068260\">https://forum-en.guildwars2.com/forum/community/api/HTTP-access/first#post2068260</a></p>","arenanet":false},{"pubDate":"2013-06-13T11:49:44.000Z","guid":"http://forum-en.guildwars2.com/forum/community/api/Access-to-API-with-http-instead-of-https/2205775","author":"Daze.6914","body":"\n<p>Hello,</p>\n<p>I would like make my app (GW2 WvW) available to Windows Phone 7 devices as well as Windows Phone 8 one (no problem with these) but I can’t since there’s is an issue with the security certificate of guildwars2.com thus not giving access to the API.</p>\n<p>For more details see topic: <br>\n<a href=\"https://forum-en.guildwars2.com/forum/support/forum/Can-t-access-to-guildwars2-com-from-WP7-8\">https://forum-en.guildwars2.com/forum/support/forum/Can-t-access-to-guildwars2-com-from-WP7-8</a></p>\n<p>Would it be feasible to allow access to the API with http to avoid this issue with WP7 devices (I’d really like to be able to use my own app on my phone)?</p>\n<p>Thanks.</p>","arenanet":false}]}
