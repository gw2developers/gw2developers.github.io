I remember this was asked a long time ago and the idea at the time was looked down on because the voice and sound teams worked really hard to get all that dialogue in there in the first place: there’s sooo much dialogue in this game and hiring more voice actors to read the same lines over and over or even voice modulation would be time and effort that could be best spent on other things.

Could it be something added in?</p>","arenanet":false}]}
