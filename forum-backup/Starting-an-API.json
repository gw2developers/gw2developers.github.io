Very neat. And if the programmers of the old C++ code have been ‘slacking’ significant performance increases may be achieved by using this conversion tool.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately CLANG is not mature on the Windows platform yet.

Goole ‘socket programming in c’. Here is the first search result, a small introduction to socket programming (it can’t get smaller than that):</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/586000/Networking-and-Socket-programming-tutorial-in-C\">http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/586000/Networking-and-Socket-programming-tutorial-in-C</a></p>\n<p>If you want to understand the core components of network programming, you should look at socket programing. The example link above is for unix socket programming. You may want to refine your google search to find out the small differences to make it work on windows or to find examples for windows. When you have learned the absolute basics, you will want to look into blocking/non-blocking I/O and/or asynchronous I/O (ioctl handlers and/or multi-theading).</p>\n<p>I am not sure what you mean by ‘the inline functions … inside the wininet code’. But see below ‘Documentation’.</p>\n<p>1) Documentation<br>\nUse msdn to view documentation about the microsoft functions. Google is your friend. Usually I just google the function, fx ‘google internetreadfile’. Then I look for a link to msdn.com. The first link if you google is ‘InternetReadFile function (Windows) – MSDN – Microsoft’. Read the page. And if you have the time, spend some time browsing msdn. When you have read about the function then search for examples using the function. Always use google to (or books) to see documentation for the individual functions. To learn general windows programing I recommend the book ‘Programming Windows, 5th Edition, by Charles Petzold’.  If you don’t have it  already, get the C bible ‘Kernighan and Ritchie: The C Programming Language’. Also get the C++ bible ‘The C++ Programming Language by Bjarne Stroustrup’. Bjarne has written some additional books, fx books that describe C++11. I don’t think MSVC supports C++11 fully yet – if you want to play with C++11 you should install a unix like operating systsem (using a vm if you like) and take a look at the CLANG compiler and play around with it. The good thing about CLANG (and you should use the VIM editor) is that you can get additional modules for it that enables you to beautify your code, test for memory leaks, stack/buffer under/overflows, race conditions etc. So CLANG is really IMO top of the pops with regards to C++ compilers atm.</p>\n<p>2) Learn by example<br>\nYou should try to develop some examples from scratch by yourself. This is a very good learning process. Also, if you can find a book or links that contains examples or exercises and solutions – do that.</p>\n<p>3) Divide and conquer / Keep it simple<br>\nYou should try to make your projects as small as possible. Each project should be about something that you will eventually use in y our bigger projects. Some examples could be:<br>\n- a program that combines 2 images (image files/buffers) into another image (image file/buffer).<br>\n- a program that reads a file from the internet (examples are already mentioned above)<br>\n- a program that plays with JSON data.<br>\n- etc</p>\n<p>4) Encapsulate your code to make it robust and re-usable<br>\nWhen you divide and conquer and keep things simple, it enables you to more easily encapsulate your code. And eventually it will make it easy to reuse your small projects in  your bigger projects.</p>","arenanet":false},{"pubDate":"2013-11-12T08:50:41.000Z","guid":"http://forum-en.guildwars2.com/forum/community/api/Starting-an-API/3189669","author":"Wolf Fivousix.4319","body":"\n<p>Thank you Sorenrye and Heimdall, I managed to make both codes work, but I still can’t see how I’d got into this stuff even playing around with the functions.

Below the text you will see a small example program that shows you how to use wininet to download a file.</p>\n<p>Start visual studio, create a new project ’Win32 Console Application\". Copy the code example from stackoverflow into your new project and build the project.</p>\n<p>Currently the program downloads stackoverflows main page and writes it to the file output.txt. You should run the compiled program to test that this is the case.</p>\n<p>If you change this line in the program from:</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;const ::WCHAR URL[] = L\"http://stackoverflow.com/\";</p>\n<p>to</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;const ::WCHAR URL[] = L\"https://render.guildwars2.com/file/02EFB1C5E11B2FF4B4AC25A84E2302D244C82AA3/66958.png\";</p>\n<p>Then the program will download the image to the file output.txt. Rename the file to output.png and view it in your browser to verify that this is the case. Note that each line above (theWCHAR URL lines)  are a single lines – your browser may wrap the lines.</p>\n<p>I tested the example on an old PC that had visual studio 2010 installed, and it worked fine.</p>\n<p>If you are new at programming, you should learn by example. Stackoverflow has a lot of other examples that you can learn from.</p>\n<p>I wish you luck in your endeavors.</p>\n<p>PS. You may want to change the inline filenames to command line arguments. I don’t know in which context you want to use this, but for testing purposes the example is ok. I am not associated with stackoverflow in any way, and I hope I didn’t break any forum rules by refering to stackoverflow.</p>\n<p>PPS: You may want to take a look at the microsoft project: C++ REST SDK (codename “Casablanca”).

It is a good idea to read through each service’s description to better understand what data you can query Also, this is your chance to consider what specific information you’d be most interested in pulling down first when you eventually start coding.</p>\n<p><em>It’s tempting, as a first-time explorer, to say, “I’m going to get ALL the THINGS!” But, if this really is your first foray, having a simple, concrete goal will keep you focused and less prone to failure.</em></p>\n<p>Next, look through a couple of endpoints on the wiki. It might not be obvious, but all of the services return their data in the same lightweight data-interchange format, called <a href=\"http://www.json.org\">JSON</a> (short for “Javascript Object Notation”).</p>\n<p>Portable data formats have come a long way in the last twenty years, and JSON is one of the simplest among them. It only is capable of encoding 6 types of values:</p>\n<ul>\n\t<li>string</li>\n\t<li>number</li>\n\t<li>array\n\t<ul>\n\t\t<li>ordered collection of other value types</li>\n\t</ul></li>\n\t<li>boolean (yes/no)</li>\n\t<li>object\n\t<ul>\n\t\t<li>a key/value pair;</li>\n\t\t<li>‘key’ must be a string;</li>\n\t\t<li>‘value’ must be one of the 6 other valid types;</li>\n\t\t<li>don’t confuse these with C++-type objects</li>\n\t</ul></li>\n\t<li>and null\n\t<ul>\n\t\t<li>aka, a value defined as having “no value”</li>\n\t</ul></li>\n</ul>\n<p>The entirety of a single JSON response can only be structured in one of two ways: as an array of values (referred to as an <em>ordered set</em>), or an object value (referred to as an <em>unordered set</em>). You will never see a valid JSON response that doesn’t begin with one of these two structures.</p>\n<ul>\n\t<li>In the case of the array (ordered set), the JSON response starts and ends with square brackets (“[ … ]”).</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n\t<li>In the case of an object value (unordered set), the JSON response starts and ends with curly braces (“{ … }”).</li>\n</ul>\n<p><em>JSON has no concept of indentation, or other textual formatting attributes. However, it is often helpful to “pretty-print” your responses; paste your JSON text into <a href=\"http://jsonlint.com\">JSONLint</a> to see it human readable.</em></p>\n<p>Now, for an example: let’s take a look at the <a href=\"http://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/API:1/files\">/files endpoint</a>.</p>\n<p>This service returns an unordered set of other objects. When we pluck out the first object in the set, we see:<br>\n</p><pre><code>\n    \"map_complete\": {\n        \"file_id\": 528724,\n        \"signature\": \"5A4E663071250EC72668C09E3C082E595A380BF7\"\n    },\n</code></pre><p></p>\n<p>Turns out, this first object was, itself, an unordered set of other objects.</p>\n<p>If we read the documentation for the /files endpoint, we find out that the data returned is meant to be used in conjunction with the <a href=\"http://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/API:Render_service\">render service</a> endpoint. <strong>A lot of GW2 services work like this</strong>; it’s too much of burden to return every single detail about something, so instead, you’ll get a lot of reference IDs to use as input to other services.</p>\n<p>In all, once you’ve comprehended the extent of what information is available from GW2’s APIs, understand the format the data is being transmitted in, and grasp the manner in which services work in tandem, you’re finally ready to write code that does the actual work.</p>\n<p>Like XML in it’s heyday, there is no shortage of languages with frameworks which help you work with JSON. I suggest Python, Ruby, or JavaScript (obviously) to start; these languages enable you to query GW2’s APIs in just few lines of code.</p>\n<p>To see examples of community-built GW2 frameworks (in various language), check out the <a href=\"http://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/API:List_of_wrappers\">list of API wrappers on the wiki</a>.</p>","arenanet":false},{"pubDate":"2013-10-16T07:55:14.000Z","guid":"http://forum-en.guildwars2.com/forum/community/api/Starting-an-API/3033684","author":"Heimdall.4510","body":"\n<p>If you want to see some example code in C/C++ for the Gw2-API have a look at my codeplex repo: <a href=\"https://gw2apicpp.codeplex.com\">https://gw2apicpp.codeplex.com</a><br>\nThe API-part is currently not rly managed since I don’t have much time atm.<br>\nI would suggest you to start with the official APIs first before implementing the tp-API because for that you need session keys from a login</p>","arenanet":false},{"pubDate":"2013-10-16T05:31:15.000Z","guid":"http://forum-en.guildwars2.com/forum/community/api/Starting-an-API/3033059","author":"Wolf Fivousix.4319","body":"\n<p>Hello everyone, after reading about the API’s and seeing what they’re able to do I would like to make something of my own.
