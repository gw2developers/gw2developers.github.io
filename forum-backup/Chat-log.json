I think a lot of people still have a disconnect between how this information would work for DPS meters versus games like WoW.</p>\n<p>The quick version is that in WoW, when in a party, everyone’s “battle info” (what attacks they used, how much damage it did, etc) is public — everyone in that party in the same combat is able to receive the “battle info” from everyone else. This allows DPS meters to calculate not only individual performances but to also compare them to the performances of everyone else recorded during a certain period.</p>\n<p>In GW2, the “battle info” for everyone is private — even if you’re in the same combat with your entire party, the only information you receive is from yourself. This means DPS meters can only tell you what you did during a certain period. You can consider this method of DPS meter as “opt-in”, as Terrasque said earlier in this thread.</p>\n<p>The other important distinction, since the meter is optional to use and only works for the individual, is that these meters can be falsified. In a WoW style meter, since the information is publicly available to anyone, the data can be corroborated by having multiple meters tracking the same fight, and comparing/averaging the results from all meters. Since GW2 information can only be tracked by one person at a time, it’s no more reliable than a person making up numbers with no evidence at all.</p>\n<p>Overall, that means the general use case for DPS meters are (a) people interested in monitoring/improving their performance, because (b) people who want to rank each other based on “battle info” cannot do accurately (since information cannot be verified)</p>","arenanet":false},{"pubDate":"2016-02-09T23:55:33.000Z","guid":"http://forum-en.guildwars2.com/forum/community/api/Chat-log/5978445","author":"TerrorBite.7603","body":"\n<blockquote><div class=\"citey\"><cite title=\"Posted on February 08 2016 09:35PM\"><a href=\"/forum/community/api/Chat-log/5976541\">LordEnki.9283:</a></cite></div><div class=\"quotey\"><p>I didn’t spend three years in a game that wasn’t WoW just to have it taken over by WoW players and turned into WoW.

It will not allow you to see or monitor anyone else’s DPS. And you are certainly under no obligation to share any personal DPS data should you decide to obtain it.</p>\n<p>Tools to calculate your personal DPS by viewing the combat log already exist (i.e. janxnx), but they work by imperfect methods (capturing screenshots of the combat log) that can be inaccurate, and have annoying prerequisites (combat log must be visible on screen at all times, interface size set to a specific size, etc).
