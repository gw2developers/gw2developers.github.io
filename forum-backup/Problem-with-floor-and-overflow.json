It ..kind of.. works well. But I wanted to make it work with other places, such as Labyrinthe cliff and Crown pavilion.<br>\n<a href=\"http://zenyr.github.io/pocogw2/\">http://zenyr.github.io/pocogw2/</a></p>\n<p>Currently my app works like this:<br>\nif (mumble-linker-found) and (user-is-not-dragging-view) then {<br>\n  if (server-seems-valid) then fetch_event(mumble-data-server,mumble-data-map)<br>\n  else fetch_event(1021 <em>dragonbrand..mm</em>, mumble-data-map)<br>\n} else fetch_event(<em>whatever-best-match</em>, view-center-map-that-isnt-an-instance)</p>\n<p>But the problems are:<br>\n-1. Overflow servers has somewhat overflowed(&gt;int_max) number, which yields no event on events.json.<br>\n-2. I had to iterate a lot of json request to get what I wanted. Crown pavilion(929) is at floor 38. I cache all floors in localStorage but I don’t feel like I’m doing it right.<br>\n-3. Inside instance maps, there are some info about “default_floor” but the tile api does not guarantee its presence.<br>\n—* For example: floor 38 has no tile at all, but floor -10 has CoF tile<a href=\"https://tiles.guildwars2.com/1/-10/4/12/4.jpg\">https://tiles.guildwars2.com/1/-10/4/12/4.jpg</a><br>\n—* (you can set window.f to certain floor number in my app to see this)<br>\n-4. Despite there are no Crown pavilion tiles, I see Mad King’s Labyrinth at the Mists floor -27, including a corresponding waypoint. So it is not missing in purpose, just needs updates.. <a href=\"https://tiles.guildwars2.com/2/-27/5/4/27.jpg\">https://tiles.guildwars2.com/2/-27/5/4/27.jpg</a><br>\n-5. Why is there only 1 torchbearer in DR?</p>\n<p><strong>TL;DR:</strong> Overflow servers doesn’t return any events. Tile API is missing some floors. Map data scattered all around the floors.</p>","arenanet":false}]}
