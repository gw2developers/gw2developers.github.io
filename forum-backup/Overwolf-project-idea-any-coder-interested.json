I myself am a UI and industrial designer by day and a tiny mesmer by night.<br>\nI know html and some javascript, I’ve made some projects in PHP and I could probably pull this off with some ugly hacks that make programmers cringe but I’d prefer if a REAL programmer could help me.</p>\n<p>Any coders out there who still are looking for a project? I dont wanna exaplain the whole idea here but if you are interested I can send over a PDF with my idea. I can say it involves the mumble protocol and wvw.</p>","arenanet":false}]}
