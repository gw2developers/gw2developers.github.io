I used /commerce/exchange/gems with the 15% transaction fee going both way along with messing with the coins_per_gem but was only able to get to an output that’s fairly close to the actual. Are there hidden variables to the formula or am I just missing something?</p>\n<p>In any case, thank you for any answers or suggestions!</p>","arenanet":false}]}
