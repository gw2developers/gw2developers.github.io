Thinking about it, I should probably invert those… so it gives the recipe for each time you do it, but it only products 0.3 clovers or something like that. I was going off the wiki for how many of each was required to make 1 clover.<br>\nthe armor set recipes and feast recipes are mathematical estimates for how much wine, coin, and crystals are required. wiki has a range of how much is required, and I made a few at various ratings for more data points, then made a line that fit them as good as possible.  let me know if you find one that’s off :P I crafted a bunch of them, but that’s way too many to confirm by hand.</p>\n<p>Thanks for your work! I look forward to adding them to my collection.  I didn’t do a single thing with minis or tonics or ascended myself – I was focused on things that could be sold on the TP.</p>\n<p>edit: I updated the links above to include Chokapik’s recipes (now 850 recipes) as well as foraging sickle’s id and mystic clover to be the ingredients to make 1 but only output 0.31 clovers.
