It runs an array of functions one after another, waiting for a callback to be made in each function before continuing to the next. Each function is passed the results of the last.  See: <a href=\"https://github.com/caolan/async#waterfall\">https://github.com/caolan/async#waterfall</a></p>\n<p>Here is an example usage of this function I whipped up. The wvw match data is passed to the world name data and that information is combined to get a list of all wvw match-ups by name rather than by world ID.</p>\n<p>The code: <a href=\"http://pastebin.mozilla.org/2448260\">http://pastebin.mozilla.org/2448260</a></p>","arenanet":false},{"pubDate":"2013-05-24T13:11:15.000Z","guid":"http://forum-en.guildwars2.com/forum/community/api/API-Lib-for-node-js/2084393","author":"Killer Rhino.6794","body":"\n<p>Just what I was looking for, thanks!</p>","arenanet":false},{"pubDate":"2013-05-24T11:32:37.000Z","guid":"http://forum-en.guildwars2.com/forum/community/api/API-Lib-for-node-js/2084032","author":"Yoone.9461","body":"\n<p>Thank you for your work, I may use it in the future.</p>","arenanet":false},{"pubDate":"2013-05-24T10:28:30.000Z","guid":"http://forum-en.guildwars2.com/forum/community/api/API-Lib-for-node-js/2083835","author":"Sayana.5923","body":"\n<p>It looks great, nice job.

I have put together a <a href=\"http://nodejs.org\">node.js</a> module that enables easy access to the JSON API.<br>\nYou can install it with npm: <strong>npm install gw2nodelib</strong><br>\nOr view the source: <a href=\"https://github.com/TimeBomb/GW2NodeLib\">https://github.com/TimeBomb/GW2NodeLib</a></p>\n<p>I’ve added some decent documentation to the readme (see above github link), and the source code is also decently commented.</p>\n<p>The library allows you to retrieve the JSON of each of the API pages, and caches it either for the session or in a file, as you can see by the readme.<br>\nWhen I have more time (and assuming there is enough interest), I plan to add more specific methods to the lib, so you can more easily get the data you want from the API.</p>\n<p>If you have any questions/feedback/etc, feel free to either post here, PM me, or, if applicable, create an issue on GitHub. Thanks all, and happy programming!</p>","arenanet":false}]}
