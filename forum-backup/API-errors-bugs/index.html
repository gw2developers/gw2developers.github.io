<p>What the title says. (may someone sticky it, thanks)</p>
<p>I just stumbled across a minor error:</p>
<p>several item names contain double spaces like: <a href="https://api.guildwars2.com/v1/item_details.json?item_id=1794&lang=fr">https://api.guildwars2.com/v1/item_details.json?item_id=1794&amp;lang=fr</a><br>
It’s nothing that hurts, but still an error.</p>
<p>Some other items have HTML-like markup in their descriptions like <a href="https://api.guildwars2.com/v1/item_details.json?item_id=29175">https://api.guildwars2.com/v1/item_details.json?item_id=29175</a><br>
Any strip_tags function should remove it, but it doesn’t look good or may break code if it’s not removed.</p></p>

<p>I don’t see any double spaces in this example. If any exist, it’s likely an issue in the original item data too.</p>

<p>That’s intentional, though it should probably be better documented in the future since it’s a completely custom markup. If your goal is to re-create an item’s information box to look like it does in the game, you’ll need those tags to show the right color or style for the text.</p></p>

<p>I’ve seen a lot of double spaces especially in spanish and french translations – the original response to the above request looks like this, take a look on <em>Manteau de voleur solide  de l’aigle</em>:</p>
<pre><code>{"item_id":"1794","name":"Manteau de voleur solide  de l'aigle","description":"","type":"Armor","level":"60","rarity":"Rare","vendor_value":"234","game_types":["Activity",
"Dungeon",
"Pve",
"Wvw"],"flags":[],"restrictions":[],"armor":{"type":"Coat","weight_class":"Medium","defense":"202","infusion_slots":[],"infix_upgrade":{"buff":"","attributes":[{"attribute":"Power","modifier":"58"},
{"attribute":"Precision","modifier":"41"}]},"suffix_item_id":"24722"}}

</code></pre>
<p>€: it seems that most of the items with a suffix are affected (~4.5k) – there is a double space before the suffix. Oh, and there is one german item with a double space: <a href="https://api.guildwars2.com/v1/item_details.json?item_id=20286&lang=de">https://api.guildwars2.com/v1/item_details.json?item_id=20286&amp;lang=de</a></p>

<p>Id like to point out there seems to be an as-of-yet undocumented 6th state for events: “Invalid”<br>
Example: </p><pre><code>{"world_id":1017,"map_id":51,"event_id":"4F125457-A110-4860-8D76-E4AE678C3023","state":"Invalid"}</code></pre>Which is: “Escort the supplies to Siegemaster Denbi.” in Straits of Devastation.<br>
Which seems to be the status most of the time unless the event is actually active.<p></p></p>

<p>Hmm, ever since the <a href="http://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Defeat_the_Claw_of_Jormag">Claw of Jormag</a> event finished on Elona Reach, the API is stuck on the event being “active” although it should be “success” instead. Is there some problem with the event?</p></p>

<p>
<p>I may be wrong, but there are inconsistencies in boss event states, right? When a boss is killed, some events got the state ‘Success’, others ‘Warmup’.<br>
It would be great, if all events would have the same state ‘chain’ like ‘Warmup’ → (‘Preperation’) → ‘Active’ → ‘Success’ (or ‘Fail’). And then ‘Warmup’ → … again.</p></p>

<p>
<p>There is a reason why some events don’t have a success state (e.g. dragons). If you search in this forum section you’ll find a reasonable explanation from the developers about it.</p></p>

<p>Do you by any chance have a list of errors + their codes? Would be nice to be able to write error handlers around errors that we haven’t seen so far. To get ready for when something new goes wrong.</p></p>

<p>I just began few cool things whith the new API (map) and I noticed something. In map_floor.json, some sectors are repeated more than once. For example : <br>
</p><pre><code>
{"sector_id":143,"name":"Nemeton Grove","level":17,"coord":[9030.92,
15731.8]}]}
</code></pre><p></p>
<p>is repeated twice, with these coords and one more time with almost the same coords : <br>
</p><pre><code>
{"sector_id":143,"name":"Nemeton Grove","level":17,"coord":[9030.01,
15733.7]}]}
</code></pre><p></p>
<p>P.S. : Thank you so much for the tiles<img src="/include/images/smilies/smile.png"></p></p>

<p>The repeated sectors are for personal story maps.  Nemeton Grove, specifically, is also within “A Different Dream” and “Shadow of the Tree”, besides where it normally appears within Brisban Wildlands.</p></p>

<p>Right. The technical relationship between continents, floors, regions, maps, and sectors is a little bit complex. Each child object could technically be referenced by multiple parent objects. This gives map designers a lot of flexibility, especially when designing unusual maps.</p>
<p>We enforce some practical rules in our map content. For example, floors are only allowed to exist on one continent.</p></p>

<p>Yep, thanks!<img src="/include/images/smilies/smile.png"></p>
<p>Another thing:</p>
<p>the map floor API returns just 1 sector element <del>per map</del> for some maps eg: id 26: Dredgehaunt Cliffs – i believe this is not intended or is this an instace map (apparently not)?</p>

<p>I am currently working with the map API (which is great btw), trying to display a map with the differents points of interest from maps_floor.json . I currently stick to continent=1 &amp; fllor=1, but I noticed what I believe to be some inconsistencies/bugs</p>
<ul>
	<li>Mt Maelstrom and Sparkfly Fen are contained in region 8 “Steamspur Mountains” although they should imho be in region 5 “Tarnished Coast” with other maguuma maps</li>
	<li>Shouldnt the region “Tarnished Coast” be named “Maguuma Jungle” to be consistent with the ingame names?</li>
	<li>Haratis Hinterland, Bloodtide Coast and Blazeridge Steppes contain no landmarks, except for the ones of instancied areas (nothing if region 8 is skipped)</li>
</ul></p>

<p>If you open the API in your browser and search, you’ll see that those zones have 2 entries – the first one has all landmarks, while the second one only has 1 landmark.  Both of them have the same key (since that’s the map_id), so when it goes through a JSON parser, the second one overwrites the first one and you only see 1 landmark.</p>
<p>I already noted that bug here:</p>

<p>
<p>Yes, the entire API uses UTF-8 encoding. Here’s one:</p>
<p><a href="https://api.guildwars2.com/v1/guild_details.json?guild_id=09AE9272-0B2B-4CCA-938F-EDBB9CF7030F">https://api.guildwars2.com/v1/guild_details.json?guild_id=09AE9272-0B2B-4CCA-938F-EDBB9CF7030F</a></p>
<p>If I save the page to a text file, then open it with Word, it auto-detects that it’s UTF-8 encoded.  If I try to force it into the Windows (Default) encoding, it looks like this:</p>
<p>Les Nounours EnneigÃ©s</p>
<p>But in UTF-8, the double-byte e-with-acute displays correctly:</p>
<p>Les Nounours Enneigés</p>
<p>You can also see it on some items, like <a href="https://api.guildwars2.com/v1/item_details.json?item_id=31079">Mjölnir</a> and <a href="https://api.guildwars2.com/v1/item_details.json?item_id=27791">Éibhear Finn</a> and <a href="https://api.guildwars2.com/v1/item_details.json?item_id=41561">Carrot Soufflé</a>.  Or just use any non-English language.</p></p>

<p>Do you see the space between “Recette” and the colon? This is actually no space (chr 32) but some multibyte thing (nbsp) where i had to use some nasty code like </p><pre><code>str_replace(chr(194).chr(160),'',$data['name_fr'])</code></pre> to get rid of it to create correct interwiki links for it.<p></p>

<p>I was  expecting something like this \u00ae or &amp; #174;  for none ASCII characters.<br>

<p>
<p>That’s not how text encoding works – those are only <em>representations</em> of encodings.  \u0000 is only used in prose to represent a Unicode codepoint, I believe.  &amp;#00 ; is the HTML entity notation for an ASCII character – the number is the decimal representation of the character’s ASCII codepoint, i.e. &amp;#38 ; = &amp;amp ; = &amp;.</p></p>

<p>
<p>Exactly, <code>\u00ae</code> would be an <em>escape sequence</em> that is used within string sequences where either unicode characters are not acceptable (some language have such a restriction) or where you simply cannot <em>type</em> the character. The string will however actually contain a <code>0x00AE</code> character at that point (depending on the language); and not the escape sequence.</p>
<p>As Ish already explained, <code>&amp;something;</code> are SGML or XML entities—most notably known from HTML—that are used to again escape a character sequence where typing the character itself would be hard or where the document encoding cannot encode the character in question (while the target encoding does support it). In times of utf-8 being the standard encoding, this is usually not necessary though, so the only commonly used entities are <code>&amp;quot;</code> for <code>"</code>, <code>&amp;lt;</code> for <code>&lt;</code> and <code>&amp;gt;</code> for <code>&gt;</code> which all encode special characters that are part of the syntax.</p></p>

<p><strong>Events get stuck on Active</strong></p>
<p>Hi, I’m calling the events API (“<a href="https://api.guildwars2.com/v1/events.json">https://api.guildwars2.com/v1/events.json</a>?…”) <br>
and pretty often events that has been completed are not reset to “warmup”,“fail”,“success” or anything else, they remain active.<br>
from my experience it happens specifically with bosses.</p>
<p>at first i though this was a caching issue but even when i deleted the browser cache and added a random parameter the statuses remain active.</p>

<p>It seems a lot of Items were readded to the items pool after the recent changes on magic find, for example:</p>
<p><a href="https://api.guildwars2.com/v1/item_details.json?item_id=28586">https://api.guildwars2.com/v1/item_details.json?item_id=28586</a><br>

<p>Is it for sure that the infix_upgrade is missing for all the “old” items, so that we can 100% tell which are the “new” ones? Or would it be possible to add something like a “deprecated” flag if not? Otherwise it would sooner or later mess up the IDs which are added to the wiki articles, i guess.</p></p>

<p>The new ruin objectives do not update to the “neutral” status, they always keep the color of the owner before going neutral. The way it’s now it is rather useless.</p>
<p>Furthermore it would be nice to get information who has which Bloodlust buff, because it’s almost impossible to safely recognize who gained the buff with the data we have.</p></p>

<p>Consolidating my bug reports from other threads:</p>
<p>The item id 43948 is returned by items.json but querying for it in <a href="https://api.guildwars2.com/v1/item_details.json?item_id=43948">https://api.guildwars2.com/v1/item_details.json?item_id=43948</a> returns an error.<br>

<p>The composition of the WvW scores seem to be skewed towards EB with close to 90%<br>
of a team score coming from EB.  Is this just temporary and has something to do with this weeks downtime and a score adjustment ?</p></p>

<p>
<p>I am not sure if this is the intended behaviour, but the events.json, event_details.json and event_status all have different count of unique event_ids.</p>
<p>At least as of last 24 hours (could be longer) I see that:<br>
- events.json has 3109 unique eventIDs for a given world_id…tested with 1017, 1014,1009<br>
- event_names.json has 3114 unique eventIDs<br>
- event_details.json returns 3202 unique eventIDs</p>
<p>From what I can gather, the extra data in event_details.json that are not in events.json were events like “Defeat the Aetherblade Captain”.</p>
<p>Some of the extra event_ids:</p>
<p>“FD66B2CD-EF72-4B9A-BDBC-A5D1DB1E3E02”<br>
“FD20EBD4-kitten-46F9-8CF6-AABBCB31B8C4”<br>

“E726E373-98FA-4577-9CA5-A0BAB2CE5ED3”</p>
<p>Should the API not return all of the same event_ids in each of the above JSON?</p>
<p>Thanks for your advice.</p></p>

<p>Hi Felicja,</p>
<p>The events.json and event_names.json are flushed on each new release, and get populated as events happen in real time.  While the event_details.json enumerates all events ever seen.  Some of your cited events such as the “Defeat the Aetherblade Captain” may no longer be happening in newer releases, which is why then don’t get populated in the events.json.</p></p>

<p>Not sure if this is the correct place to post this but it appears that <a href="http://www.gw2spidy.com/item/37138">Versatile Simple Infusion</a> isn’t in the API.<br>
gw2spidy.com has as the correct item ID in the URL. So the ID of the mentioned infusion should be 37138 but returns as <a href="https://api.guildwars2.com/v1/item_details.json?item_id=37138">invalid item</a>.</p></p>

<p>Those have always been missing, due to how the game reports “discovered” items – karma vendors aren’t in the loop for some reason.</p></p>

<p>I finally fixed the problem with the missing items, recipes, events from the previous reset we had about a month ago.  I was hoping they would get re-discovered, but as people noticed this wasn’t happening in a timely fashion.  It wasn’t a trivial thing to re-seed this, but it is done now.  Let me know if you are still noticing anything missing.  Thank you.</p></p>

<p>
<p>Just a quick fix I hope for this one. Someone touched on this previously:<br>
The API at <a href="https://api.guildwars2.com/v1/files.json">https://api.guildwars2.com/v1/files.json</a> has no entries for:<br>
- Vista (seen)<br>
- Vista (not seen)<br>
- Skill Challenge (complete)<br>
- Skill Challenge (not complete)<br>
And whilst I’m at it, these are also not available but still noteworthy:<br>
- Merchant (coins icon)<br>
- Trading post<br>
- Bank<br>
- Repair NPC<br>
- Weapons dealer<br>
- Armor dealer<br>
- Commander<br>
- Party member dot (the blue dot)<br>
- All the crafting icons<br>
- Asura Gates<br>
- Event type icons (e.g. the icon for ‘NPC wants you to bring them stuff’)</p>
<p>I think that is mostly it. It would be great if someone could just toss these in the JSON.</p></p>

<p>Hi Smiley,</p>
<p>It turns out those items were “in-development” items that either were rejected or supposed to be replaced with other items.  We are not sure exactly how they got “discovered”.  In the meantime I’ve removed them from the API.  If they show up again, we’ll have to track down how they are getting discovered.</p>
<p>As for the additional files.json entries: I’ll try to get what I can included as soon as possible and will reply when updated.</p></p>

<p>Hey Stefan,</p>
<p>thanks for the update. My guess is that those items haven’t been discovered but were added with some content updates. (e.g. the Mr Funkel minipet – i don’t think it had to be discovered – also it had a correct name before – we track item renaming → <a href="http://gw2wbot.darthmaim.de/rss/renamedItems/">http://gw2wbot.darthmaim.de/rss/renamedItems/</a><img src="/include/images/smilies/wink.png"> )</p></p>

<p>I have also something small to report, while iterating over the maps.json entries, it occured to me that the Borderlands do not have their colors listed (map ids 94, 95 and 96). While the english ones have the name " Borderlands" (note the extra space), the spanish are worse: "Tierras fronterizas de ". Now I’m not spanish, but I think “de” can be read as something like “of”. So there’s definitely missing something here :p.</p>

<p>Thats not a bug. These names are just pre- and suffixes (depending on the language) for the current map name so that you just need to add the worldname to it.</p>
<p>e.g. my homeworld is “Ring of Fire”, so it would end up in “Ring of Fire Borderlands” – in spanish it would be “Anillo de Fuego” for the world, and the map would be named “Tierras fronterizas de Anillo de Fuego”</p></p>

<p>Oh wow, that’s on purpose then? Bit weird to do it this way though in my opinion. Oh well, thanks for clarifying it.</p>
<p>But wait, how do you explain the french one then: “Territoires frontaliers ( )”? That’s neither a prefix nor suffix.</p></p>

<p>The french one seems indeed a bit weird – at least inconsistent to the others. So in french would be possibly “Cercle de feu” → “Territoires frontaliers (Cercle de feu)”. Since these names apparently are taken directly from the game (including bugs) i guess theres some string replacement done here.

<p>I investigate this a bit.  It turns out as you suspected there is some concatenation at play here, as dictated by some special markup and is different for each language translation.  As in:</p>
<ul>
	<li>EN: <span>%str2</span>% Borderlands</li>
	<li>FR: Territoires frontaliers (%str2% )</li>
	<li>ES: Tierras fronterizas de[pl:""] <span>%str2</span>%</li>
	<li>DE: <span>%str1</span>% Grenzlande</li>
</ul>
<p>Unfortunately, what we render in the API is after the concatenation markup is trimmed out (and presumably replaced with an empty string).  I did a brief investigation on how I might be able to render the name with markup, but it will require more work than I can afford right now.  I’ll keep this noted as a bug.</p>
<p>thank you!</p></p>

<p>Stefan,</p>
<p>thanks for the clarification. So it turns out, the spanish names are even trickier than the others because of the “plural identifier” – i guess there’s an “s” being added like “de” -&gt; “des”. So would it be possible to ignore the spanish grammar for a while and just replace the map name with a placeholder instead of an empty string so that we could simply use functions like <a href="http://php.net/manual/function.sprintf.php">sprintf()</a>? Like so:</p>
<pre><code>{
	"de": "%s Grenzlande",
	"en": "%s Borderlands",
	"es": "Tierras fronterizas de %s",
	"fr": "Territoires frontaliers (%s)"
}</code></pre>
<p>If you could provide us a list of the “plural named” maps, you could even use numbered placeholders then:</p>
<pre><code>{
	"de": "%1$s Grenzlande",
	"en": "%1$s Borderlands",
	"es": "Tierras fronterizas de%2$s %1$s",
	"fr": "Territoires frontaliers (%1$s)"
}</code></pre></p>

<p>The map names API is bugged. It is only returning 10 map names:<br>
[{"id":“15”,“name”:"Queensdale"},<br>
{"id":“24”,“name”:“Gendarran Fields”},<br>
{"id":“28”,“name”:“Wayfarer Foothills”},<br>
{"id":“30”,“name”:“Frostgorge Sound”},<br>
{"id":“73”,“name”:“Bloodtide Coast”},<br>
{"id":“62”,“name”:“Cursed Shore”},<br>
{"id":“53”,“name”:“Sparkfly Fen”},<br>
{"id":“34”,“name”:“Caledon Forest”},<br>
{"id":“19”,“name”:“Plains of Ashford”},<br>
{"id":“943”,“name”:“Tower of Nightmares”}]<br>
I am using the map names in my Windows application to filter events by map and this bug is making my app pretty much useless right now.<br>
Until this gets fixed can someone provide the whole list of maps and map ID so I can hard-code them in my app ?<br>
Thanks!</p></p>

<p>Recipe 9642 (<a href="https://api.guildwars2.com/v1/recipe_details.json?recipe_id=9642">link</a>)</p>
<p>This recipe does not specify a single crafting discipline. Also, its output item ID (<a href="https://api.guildwars2.com/v1/item_details.json?item_id=66200">66200</a>) does not exist in the item details API.</p>
<p>Further research indicates that this recipe produces an “Unidentified Orange Dye”.<br>
Chat link codes:</p>
<ul>

</ul>
<p>If this recipe clearly exists in the game, why does the API behave like this?</p></p>

<p>I wouldn’t consider this as a bug, not even an error. For example imagine some SQL:</p>
<pre><code>SELECT * FROM table WHERE id IN(404,404,404,404)</code></pre>
<p>This is totally valid and would return exactly one line.</p></p>

<p>
<p>It’s a bug because it is (indirectly) violating a design constraint. The constraint would be:<br>
X-Result-Count &lt;= X-Result-Total</p>
<p>I suppose they could just decide to increase the Total by 1 for each duplicate identifier, but I’d rather get an error.</p>

<p>
<p>Look again at what i’ve quoted.</p>
<p>I don’t agree that passing duplicate identifiers is a bug. (in fact: it’s compensating bad programming on the client side)<br>
I agree that the output is bugged.</p>
<p>However, it’s still too early to report/discuss v2 bugs. The v2 API is still in the works and not officially released yet.</p></p>

<p>You suggest that I should be allowed to request ?ids=404,404,404 but get only a single response object even though my program is expecting three objects? Nope, nope, nope, so much nope.</p></p>

<p>So does SQL. If you really think the API should act in a way YOUR program expects it to work, you’re wrong.</p>
<p>So tell me why:</p>
<ul>
	<li>should the API return an error</li>
	<li>should it return the SAME object more than once</li>
</ul>
<p>when you sent duplicate identifiers? How would your program handle the result of a SQL “…WHERE … IN(…) …”?</p></p>

<p>Exactly my point… it should crash with an error.</p>
<pre><code>

{"text":"request contains duplicate identifiers."}

</code></pre>
<p>My program doesn’t expect the API to return an error, because I’m not violating any protocols. But instead of leaving my program in an invalid state ( count &lt; expected ), I now have an error code that I can use to throw an exception.</p></p>

<p>
<p>Honestly, i don’t care how YOUR program works. If it’s unable to handle the response to what it asked for, you should rewrite it. Keep that SQL in mind, this is actually what to expect as response when duplicate identifiers are sent.</p></p>

<p>We’ve already established that they are not using that particular SQL construct. Otherwise we wouldn’t be getting duplicate objects in the response content.</p></p>

<p>The output is incorrect, but returning output other than what is requested is also incorrect. I don’t expect a fish when I ask for a basket of eggs.</p>

<p>
<p>So you really expect the API to do something like that:</p>
<pre><code>foreach($identifiers as $identifier){
  SELECT * FROM table WHERE id = $identifier
}</code></pre>

<p>
<p>I don’t know if that’s how they implemented it, but at least that’s how it behaves right now. So I’m using that as the specification.</p>
<p>They may have written it like this:</p>
<pre><code>
SELECT * FROM quaggans WHERE ID = "404"

SELECT * FROM quaggans WHERE ID = "404"

<p>Processing and returning the same result more than once is just stupid. Assigning the result rows to the requested identifiers can be easily handled on the client side.</p>

<p>Well, no. The /v2 page that was posted on twitter didn’t even have an entry for /v2/quaggans. They added quaggans to the list a couple of weeks later, unlocked, presumably to help you and me get acquainted with the new syntax. I don’t know why they never made a public announcement, but that could mean anything  (including nothing).</p></p>

<p>Seriously? You compare data to physical eggs? You should better work in a supermarket when you think that way.</p>
<p>You asked for 40x the same string of text. You get it once instead because i don’t want to write it down 40 times as it would be a waste of my resources, but you are free to copy it as many times you want.</p></p>

<p>I swear I’m not making this up.</p>
<p>Assuming that you have an error handler that sits somewhere between the code that makes the request and the code that handles the response. This error handler is the same for all services, because the error response is the same for all services. It doesn’t matter which service gives you the finger, because your error handler has got your back.</p>
<p>On the other hand, things gets complicated a lot faster if you have to verify that the response is what you’d expect for each and every request that you make. It is not unlikely that you’d end up writing custom code for each endpoint.</p>
<p>Furthermore, if you know that you will only get what you asked for, you can make other assumptions about your code such as how big an array has to be to fit all elements inside. I know that this doesn’t apply to PHP, but it does in C# and other languages.</p></p>

<p>Ok, programming 101:</p>
<p>You have a list of numbers which you want to send to an API and get the corresponding data for each of them. The API accepts duplicates of the numbers for convinience but returns just one result for <strong>each unique</strong>. Now back in your program you loop through your list of numbers and assign the data you recieved to each of them. This is possible. In (nearly) any language. Profit.</p></p>

<p>
<p>Custom code alert.</p>
<p>I can do the same thing through reflection if the response did have the duplicate entries. But the duplicates break the X-Result headers, so we can’t have duplicates. So we can’t have reflection. Unless we get errors.</p>

<p>My 2 cents regarding cloned Quaggans:<br>
API should not waste resource printing duplicate items (Quaggans are 35, but what happen when you have to search in 36000 items?). I think that it should check for duplicate, if duplicates are found it should throw an error with a 302 HTTP redirect to the list of same objects without duplicates.<br>
In this way error is thrown, and is also very easy to correct the wrong request (that is very helpful if list are hand-written).<br>
It is also a solution accessible, and easly applicable, by (I think) all endpoints.</p></p>

<p>
<p>I like that idea. There’s also HTTP 303 “See Other”. It is similar to HTTP 302, but with a subtle difference that makes it more suitable:</p>
<blockquote><div class="quotey"><p>A 303 response to a GET request indicates that the origin server does<br>
   not have a representation of the target resource that can be<br>
   transferred by the server over HTTP.  However, the Location field<br>
   value refers to a resource that is descriptive of the target<br>
   resource, such that making a retrieval request on that other resource<br>
   might result in a representation that is useful to recipients <strong>without<br>
   implying that it represents the original target resource</strong>.</p></div></blockquote>

<p>We can look at standardizing those some, but both are correctly returning a 400 bad request. It gets exciting since the API is a layer on top of many backend services and those don’t all agree on how to respond to things.</p>
<p>That said, you should always determine if the request was an error by inspecting the HTTP status code &amp; not the contents of the response.</p></p>

<p>I’m not sure if this is even worth looking at, but there’s still that bug where IIS crashes with a text/html response when the parameter list gets too big. Probably because IIS/ARR and the private API do not agree on the maximum URL length.</p>

<p>The only problem I see in that request is that the server reply with a 404 error instead of 414 error. The URL is 2215 character long, it should be less than 2000, and the request is to have 550 items where you should only request 200. I think that you cannot have a json reply in this case, because in my opinion your request is stopped and rejected by IIS, it never reach API level. I don’t know IIS, but this response is seems to me like error page configured in apache, in this case when apache read the request, it reject it and reply with its default error page (in this case reply with a 404 error, but it should reply with 414 error) that it’s a plain html file similar to all error page saw in GW2 web services. Probably they never thought that they need a 414 page error (for a normal web service like website or forum is really uncommon to have url length problem) and didn’t created that page error, so the server reply with a default 4xx error.</p></p>

<p>I think this behavior is caused by a setting in the Request Filtering module (<a href="http://www.iis.net/configreference/system.webserver/security/requestfiltering">http://www.iis.net/configreference/system.webserver/security/requestfiltering</a>).

<p><em>When request filtering blocks an HTTP request, IIS 7 will return an HTTP 404 error to the client and log the HTTP status with a unique substatus that identifies the reason that the request was denied.</em></p>
<p>So, to disable the filter:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Open IIS Manager and connect to the gateway server that routes the requests</li>
	<li>Click the root node of the server in the “Connections” panel</li>
	<li>Double click “Request filtering” in the “Features View” panel</li>

<p>I can stop a user from passing more than 200 identifiers, but I can’t stop a user from passing 200 times the maximum value for a 32 bit integer (2147483647). The precision here is 10, so that alone adds up to 2000 characters. That’s still less than 2048, but then you’re forgetting about the delimiters.</p></p>

<p>
<p>If you’re passing a user through to the API, it’s generally considered your responsibility to either guide them through it or stop it from sending stuff you know won’t work and will cause technical problems. Which means either you count up the commas and validate or you just strip off whatever gets passed through after the last comma from your server request when the query string hits the limit.</p>
<p>Just my own opinion on the matter. It definitely should be adjusted to show the correct error at some point, but in terms of the actual effect , it’s pretty negligable. You know you can only get 200 items back, so you should write to that reality anyway.</p></p>

<p>Having client side validation is good. Only having client side validation is bad. Our library comes with options to disable parameter validation in release mode (to save some CPU cycles), so there will still be times when a user passes some ridiculous value that doesn’t work, but doesn’t actually violate the protocol.</p></p>

<p>It’s sound simple to me, when you have a not HTTP 200 response from the server trow an exception to the user and force a client side validation. You should simply stop when you don’t get an 200 response from the server. 414 error instead of 404 it’s a semanthic problem, you should everytime stop when not receiving an HTTP 200 reply from the server, regardless of the exactly error you get.</p></p>

<p>Guys, the problem was never the status code. The problem is the text/html content-type along with the HTML body.</p>
<pre><code>

<p>You have to draw a line somewhere between what is and isn’t violating the interface.

<p>I manage a server and I’ll never disable this feature:<br>
1) URLs long than 2000 characters are useless, you are doing something wrong if you need them (in example you should use POST instead of GET request).<br>
2) It’s a security feature, I don’t work in server security (I only try to secure my server), but if someone think that this is a security feature there should be good reasons. I can speculate that GET headers requests are stored in ram until they are completly received (POST should be directly writed to disk I think). When a GET request exceed a certain amount of data, the server stop to accept the request and reply with an error. The client may continue to send the request, but the server drop any further data coming from that request. Disabling such a feature will force the server to wait (and load in ram) the entire request before thinking of a reply. What will happen if you send 2000 simultaneously request each with 200000000 characters with this security feature disabled? The server start to load each request in ram, and wait until each request is completly received, server will start to have ram problem very soon, will start to use swap, will slow down, and will crash if such type of request continue to come. The results are that it’s not necessary a lot of bandwidth to crash a server, it’s only needed that you send multiple request at the same time. So disabling this feature will let GW2 API server be very vulnerable to DOS attacks, that in this case may cause a server crash, not only a service interruption.</p>
<p>It’s never a good idea to disable a security feature, expecially if it is enabled by default.</p>

<p>World name is disabled. It’s the API level that reply with a 404 error, not IIS, it’s a lot different.<br>
Anyway, 404 is a wrong error in this case, maybe 403 is better, but it’s still a semantics problem. The really important thing is that there is a problem with your request, in this case you should not request for world_names.json, because it is disabled.</p>

<p>Because they are two really different problem.<br>
With 201 items you will not get a reply from the <strong>Database</strong>, because it will require too much time and database resource (developer decided that 201 items request are not acceptable).<br>
With 550 item, it’s not a problem that you are requesting 550 items, the problem is that your request URL is too long, your request is not acceptable from the IIS server because may be a security issue (I guess that may overcharge server ram), you will not get a reply from the <strong>API</strong> (that could reply in JSON that 550 items are too much). The request is stopped by IIS, API never know that you made such request. How could API reply if it doesn’t know that you ever made a request?</p>
<p>I hope that this little schema will let you understand, normaly request come from the top, go until bottom and then come back to the top.<br>
</p><pre><code>
    Client
         |
        IIS      2215 URL length request stop here, don't  go down

         |
 DataBase  less than 201 items request come here and go back to top
 </code></pre><p></p>
<p>API talk with json, IIS talk with predefined error file (in this case we don’t have a 414 error file, so we get a 404 instead)</p></p>

<p>API request will get a JSON reply as much as your request reach the API, to let your request reach the API you MUST do request with less than 2000 characters. As much as you request less than 500 items be assured that you will receive a JSON error, if you exceed 500 items you cannot get a JSON reply.<br>
So the limit to get a JSON reply, is something near 500 items, try with 500 items and you get a JSON reply, try with more than about 2000 characters and you will get a standar erro page.</p>
<p>I understand that those thing are not easy to understand, but your request (have always JSON reply) is not really applicable. I hope now you understand why.</p></p>

<p>The one thing nobody has addressed so far is the 10 digit precision problem.</p>
<p>I can devise a request that passes validation for every rule in place right now:</p>
<ul>
	<li>No more than 200 identifiers</li>
	<li>All identifiers are numeric, 32 bit integers</li>
	<li>No two identifiers are the same</li>
</ul>
<p>…yet my request will result in a crash.</p>
<p><a href="http://pastebin.com/Pipvc4VS">http://pastebin.com/Pipvc4VS</a></p>
<p>I understand perfectly well <em>why</em> this is happening. You need to understand why this <em>shouldn’t</em> be happening. Not unless you introduce another validation rule that invalidates my request regardless of the maximum allowed query string. But what sort of rule would that be?</p>
<p>Keep in mind that they have to be API-level validation rules. That means forget that the query string even existed before it reached the API. So no checking for length.</p></p>

<p>
<p>Ok, so the problem is that you cannot verify your url once it is generated (this is another problem, that have nothing to do with API programming!).<br>
In that case you could simply check if items ids are numeric, 32 bit integers, and less than 100000 (max known id is 67359, you will get a too long url with more than 500 items with 5 character each). <br>
I don’t know what programming language you are using, but you could get the integer part of id mod 100000 and you get a “valid” id, or at last you cannot generate an url longer than allowed in that way.</p></p>

<p>
<p>It’s just weird having to write workarounds for limitations that exist only at the transport level. Validation should only occur at the API level. And for that purpose, it shouldn’t matter if the request is encoded as a query string, or flown into the office on a piece of paper by a carrier pidgeon.</p></p>

<p>
<p>You could just split the request of too many items up into multiple requests and join them into one collection before returning them to the user.<br>
But the RFC 2616 (3.2.1) says “The HTTP protocol does not place any a priori limit on the length of a URI. Servers MUST be able to handle the URI of any resource they serve, and SHOULD be able to handle URIs of unbounded length if they provide GET-based forms that could generate such URIs.” So the API really should be able to handle a request of 200 32bit Integers, so 2000 + the length of the endpoint url.</p></p>

<p>
<p>The maximum length of a valid query string is exactly 2207 bytes.</p>
<ul>
	<li>2000 bytes for the total length of all IDs combined</li>
	<li>199 bytes for the delimiters</li>
	<li>8 bytes for the optional “&amp;lang=xx” parameter</li>
</ul>
<p>Valid in the sense that it satisfies all preconditions. Not valid in the sense that any of the IDs actually exist. So the filter should be adjusted from 2048 to 2207. The power of RFC 2616 compels you!</p></p>

If you ask to item api about an item, you will get that item info, if you send junk to item api you will get an error, if you send junk to item api server, you get an http error.<br>
It is your responsability to send a correct and understandable request to the api, you cannot complain with developers because you are not able/don’t want to clean your request.<br>

<p>
<p>That’s not how that works. There is no numeric data type that uses 17 bits in any programming language that I know of. The next step up from 16 bit is usually 32 bit, so you have to design for that. Furthermore, my request respects every precondition that is imposed by the API. What about my request makes it “junk”? The fact that my identifiers don’t exist? Maybe I know that, but my code doesn’t.</p></p>

<p>Hi. Seems to be a bug with the mumble link coordinates in the latest patch. The x coordinates are displaced a bit to the right. Anyone notice?</p></p>

<p>I don’t know if this has been posted but if you are grabbing a page at a time it will break around page 195 if your page size is 200.</p>
<p>for example: <a href="https://api.guildwars2.com/v2/items?page=195&page_size=200">https://api.guildwars2.com/v2/items?page=195&amp;page_size=200</a></p>
<p>I tried dropping it to page_size 150 but it breaks later on, I’m still testing not passing in a page size which seems to be returning 50 by default.</p>
<p>If I were to guess what the problem is, I’d say it’s how you’re joins are working in a x to many situation or multiple x to many situation.  I usually handle these by sub queries or separate queries depending on the backend API available.</p></p>

<p>
<p>Never mind it looks like that only occurs on the last page.  I wish there was a call or a way to get the number of pages based on page size or some semblance of meta data.  Right now I am actually capturing the 400 error and stopping once I receive it.</p></p>

<p>@peterpat: There are various systems in the game that have to “report” items to the API as being “discovered.”  There are still some gaps in these systems where they fail to report items correctly.</p>
<p>(You’d think it would be as simple as a check on the inventory: whenever an item is added to any character’s inventory, report that item to the API.  But apparently it’s not that simple.)</p></p>

<p>Is there any issue / or is there anyone meeting an issue with the property “name” from /v2/items ?<br>

<p>Just add a trim() <img src="/include/images/smilies/smile.png"> But it looks like that it is mainly a localization error as the line break is visible in-game, too.

<p>What a stupid <strong><em>Sticky</em> Topic</strong>.<br>
I don’t mean the original Topic/Post is stupid, the original Topic/Post is OK.<br>
It’s the fact you made it into a <strong>Sticky</strong> is silly.<br>
It’s going to end up as a Topic with a thousand pages you have to search through.</p>
<p>I would Class <strong>API errors &amp; bugs</strong> as a <strong>Category</strong> not a <strong>Topic</strong></p>
<p>If you want all errors Topics in one place create a <strong>sub-forum</strong>.</p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_forum">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_forum</a><br>
Read: <strong>Structure, Thread and Stickying</strong></p>
<p>or</p>
<p>Tag the Title of a Topics when you create one.<br>
i.e.<br>
<strong>v1/item_details.json[Error]</strong></p>
<p>Having each in a separate Topic enables the Topic to be close deleted or archived when it is no longer required.</p>
<p>Reading though pages of text to find something you may be able to help with is hard and boring. Then when you find some thing, you have to read through the rest of the pages to see if it has been sorted or not.</p></p>

<p>Sounds like TCwvw.com banned you, not an API issue. You should remove the guild tag from your account name.</p></p>

<p>Just wondering if there’s an issue with some keys again? Got notice from a member they’d lost group access (provided by the API key.) They looked at their keys page and it was seemingly still there, so I re-added the key on my end. After re-running the check, the same message that it’s an invalid key was returned, and it’s no longer within the keys page.</p></p>

<p>I have talked to that specific user and he reported that he did not delete this key but it’s not visible on his account (<a href="https://account.arena.net/applications">https://account.arena.net/applications</a>) anymore. This issue seems to only affect a ‘few’ key/accounts.</p></p>

<p>A server deploy changed some behind-the-scenes behaviors which means any keys older than about mid-July are broken. Server programmer is working on a fix, but in the mean time newly-created keys should be fine.</p>

<p>Will have to double-check with the server team to see what effects their data migration had. My understanding was that it was going to fix old keys (e.g., replace the “offline” internal permission with the “_offline” internal permission), not wipe them.</p></p>

<p>Oddly enough, that item is actually in-game as well. And craftable too, no less!</p></p>

<p>Hi,<br>
while reading recipes and items from the API, 24 items with the following ids can not be found.</p>
<p>item_id: 66177, 66178, 66179, 66180, 66181, 66182, 66183, 66184, 66185, 66186, 66187, 66188, 66189, 66190, 66191, 66192, 66193, 66194, 66195, 66196, 66197, 66198, 66199, 66200</p>
<p>Searching in the recips, I found all items as output for the following recipes</p>
<p>recipe_id: 9640, 9647, 9656, 9643, 9645, 9649, 9641, 9646, 9639, 9644, 9657, 9638, 9650, 9637, 9659, 9658, 9660, 9655, 9651, 9653, 9652, 9648, 9654, 9642</p>
<p>All recipes has the type “Dye” and the array of disciplines is empty.<br>
Could it be this recipes shoukd not exist?</p></p>

<p>Uhh, hmm. I went ahead and whitelisted the items, but after pulling up those recipes it indeed seems they are not craftable by any disciplines. I’m not really sure why they exist (or why they’re in the API), so I’m hesitant to blacklist them outright.</p>
<p>I’ll think about it for a bit and then probably remove them — if they’re uncraftable it doesn’t make sense to keep them around.</p></p>

<p>
<p>So, I was just looking at <a href="https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Box_of_Recipes:_The_Legend_(First_Tier)">this wiki article on a Box of Recipes</a> – which says there are 4 recipes that are unlocked by it.</p>
<p>The API on <a href="https://api.guildwars2.com/v2/items/71677?lang=en">that item</a> says it unlocks recipe <a href="https://api.guildwars2.com/v2/recipes/11352">11352</a> which is the first from that list.</p>
<p>The other 3 items on the list, all say “LearnedFromItem”, but there is no match on their recipe_id on all the items in the API.</p>
<ul>
	<li><a href="https://api.guildwars2.com/v2/recipes/11357">https://api.guildwars2.com/v2/recipes/11357</a> Experimental Staff Head</li>
	<li><a href="https://api.guildwars2.com/v2/recipes/11525">https://api.guildwars2.com/v2/recipes/11525</a> Experimental Staff Shaft</li>
	<li><a href="https://api.guildwars2.com/v2/recipes/10442">https://api.guildwars2.com/v2/recipes/10442</a> Legendary Inscription</li>
</ul>
<p>If this is a problem, and recipe sheets can now unlock multiple recipes, this would affect some more of the new precursor “bulk” recipe boxes, too.</p>
<p>Otherwise, what am I missing here?</p></p>

<p>Hrm, so recipe unlock items have a new field “extra recipe unlocks”. I’ll need to update /v2/items to expose that — probably won’t have a fix until the patch after next though <img src="/include/images/smilies/sad.png"></p></p>

<p>Just to be clear, I’m not really a dev and I’m just using Google Docs with a JSON script to get the data.</p>
<p>Anyways, I think I found a bug with the new guild members endpoint. According to it there’s only 93 members in our guild, while there are actually 94 people in it. I’ve also quickly found the person that was missing since it’s one of the captains.</p>
<p>Here I have ordered the list with all captains at the top: <br>
<a href="http://i.imgur.com/j2pDmrj.png">http://i.imgur.com/j2pDmrj.png</a><br>
There’s only three of them, while there should be four, like you can see here: <br>

<p>Hi,<br>
one of my Trading Post transactions (its id: 1489725948) has item_id 69595; however <a href="https://api.guildwars2.com/v2/items/69595">https://api.guildwars2.com/v2/items/69595</a> says that there is not item with such id.<br>
The same situation with: 69023 (transaction: 3355254320); 69445 (transaction: 3355006952) and 69430 (transaction: 3353027601).</p></p>

<p>Those items all have no name and the “under construction” working sign icon, so they were likely blacklisted from the API. It <strong>does</strong> look like they’re acquirable (via the jungle pvp reward track) so I’ll poke someone about that.</p>
<p>Thanks for the heads up.</p>
<p>EDIT: Turns out the issue was just on my end; went ahead and whitelisted those items. They should show up in the API at some point.</p></p>

<p>IDK if these have already been reported, but a lot of the “Explorer”-Achievements return wrong (? or unexpected) data. Orr for example: <a href="https://api.guildwars2.com/v2/achievements?ids=103&lang=en">https://api.guildwars2.com/v2/achievements?ids=103&amp;lang=en</a></p>
<p>There are multiple entries in the “bits”-structure with an empty text. As far as I have seen, those do <strong>not</strong> show up in game in the achivements-tab – only in the API (5 for Orr, 9 for Ascalon, 1 for Kryta and 3 for Maguuma).</p>
<p>And if you take a look at <a href="https://api.guildwars2.com/v2/achievements?ids=100&lang=en">https://api.guildwars2.com/v2/achievements?ids=100&amp;lang=en</a> you’ll see that “Dredgehaunt Cliffs: Tribulation Caverns” and “Timberline Falls: The Foundation Stones” show up twice (as do “Bloodtide Coast: Moriarity’s Hold” and “Gendarran Fields: Brigantine Isles” in the “Krytan Explorer”). This seems to be a more serious bug as those dupes show up inside the game if you look at the achivements (I have 100% map-completion and while both Tribulation Cavers show up as already discovered, only one of the Brigantine Isles entries shows up as discovered)</p></p>

<p>This is possibly just a case of content being weird — the API dumps out the data as it is. It’s a bit annoying that the API exposes achievement bits that are culled in the in-game UI, but they’re technically still there — since they’re cross-referenced by index in /v2/account/achievements removing them would be tricky (and potentially break things).</p>
<p>It’s important to note that for a lot of achievements you don’t need to complete all bits to be awarded the achievement — for example, Shiverpeak Explorer only requires 175 of 177 bits to be completed. The number of bits required for completion is available in the “tiers” field of /v2/achievements and/or in the “max” field of /v2/account/achievements. Thus, even though some bits are unused, you can still be awarded the achievement.</p>
<p>It’s definitely kind of weird, but my current opinion is that it isn’t broken, per say. I’ll poke someone about the Brigantine Isles dupe bit though — that seems like a bug.</p></p>

<p>Yeah, i guess documenting those “oddities” somewhere is the best solution and to just ignore them in apps.</p>

<p>There was some really terrible code I wrote in there that was causing both the NA and EU resets to flush all the data.

<p>Those are some of Scarlet’s weapons, wielded during the Queen’s Jubilee. I’m not sure how they got onto the API or why they’re called Quip, but this isn’t the first time it’s come up so I’m just going to blacklist them.</p>

<p>Yeah, I think that error message gets kicked back when you’d get less than 1 gem back. I’ll try to make the error message a bit better. There’s an open issue for this <a href="https://github.com/arenanet/api-cdi/issues/267">on github</a>.</p></p>

<p>Oops, that was my fault. Refactored some code and had kitten in my test coverage so a mis-typed scope requirement went undetected (“inventory” instead of “inventories”). Will have the fix out today.</p>

<p>Either the wallet API is wrong or the wallet in GW2 is wrong, because there’s a difference between the amount of gems I really own and the amount of gems the wallet API returns…   It looks like the API never noticed I bought some gemstore items during the SAB festival…</p></p>

<p>- Since WvW paired up with other servers I get more queues in EBG, I also get more errors from game and keep kick me out of game and wait for queue again, it happen mostly to me when there’s more presure fights in one area like zerg (20+ players) vs zerg (20+ players) fights.<br>
I hope theres’s a way to increase the capacity for people to join EBG other than normal BL and fix the errors that always happend to me.</p>
<p>- I also notice in some gates and walls in the keeps in normal border lands that when it upgrade to reinforce, the outer gate/wall is reinforce  and the inner gate/wall is reinforce but looks like a wooden.<br>
I hope this one be fixed too.<br>
Thank you.</p></p>

<p>Well at least Thunder Hollow is correct now.</p>
<p>I’m just going to hardcode the newly incorrect ones to the right places. I’m not yet sure what’s spooked them around the map, but catching them in the act is definitely going to help narrow it down a bit.</p>

<p>So, uh. What do I do about that, aside from hard coding a catch?</p>
<p>Edit: spelling and also! I think we’ve found it. I currently have the item active on a warrior sitting in the Silverwastes. So that’s the version of the item that’s in use... why is THAT not in the API?<img src="/include/images/smilies/smile.png"></p></p>

<p>Huh. The item id in your /v2/account/inventory is correct, and I’ve just now whitelisted it. It was a bit of a special case and — since it’s never been dropped in the world — it’s never shown up in the item whitelist queue. I’ve gone ahead and added it manually.</p>
<p>The other item is a container that you get after accepting the level 80 boost — not the level 80 boost itself.</p>
<p>I’ve got some code for the account bank and character inventories that pushes any unknown items into the queue automatically; I guess I’d forgotten to add it to the shared inventory slots. Though this is kind of a special-case, here’s <a href="https://github.com/arenanet/api-cdi/issues/340">a tracking issue</a> to whitelist any future unacquirable items deposited straight into an inventory.</p></p>

<p>The following three items are referenced as craftable items, but have no corresponding entry in the /v2/items API endpoint:</p>
<p>76527<br>

<p>For the three item identifiers listed above, the endpoint at <a href="https://api.guildwars2.com/v2/items/">https://api.guildwars2.com/v2/items/</a> gives {"text":“no such id”}</p>

<p>(10638, 76527)<br>
(10940, 72307)<br>

<p>Eugh, the guild upgrade items are a known issue on my end — AFAIK all of the items associated with guild upgrades are purely advisory (e.g., when you craft them the item specified in the recipe doesn’t get produced — it just gets inserted into the guild’s inventory). That the recipes refer to acquirable items is an implementation detail rather than an invariant.</p>
<p>I’ve not a clue why those items ended up in /v2/commerce/listings without ever appearing in the whitelist queue.</p>
<p>In any case, thanks for the continued reports; I’ve whitelisted all of those.</p></p>

<p>Huh, that’s super weird. It’s definitely a bug in one of the backend servers; I’ll notify the people involved and see if we can get it fixed.</p>

<p>
<p>But at the time, were i posted this, i checked ingame and there WERE buy orders. <br>
My theorie is, that it had something to do with the release of the patch, because it started 20 hours before the release of the big one and now its working again. And i checked my whole program but changed nothing.</p>
<p>My theorie is, that something overstressed that servers, so that an unfished object was send, but thats only my theorie.</p>
<p>i can confirm that its working now. and i will be here, IF it happens again<img src="/include/images/smilies/wink.png"></p>
<p>THANKS for checking!</p>
<p>(edit: I was thinking about it and i didn t mention the following: <br>
Lets say, i checked 160 items, then maybe 50-60 of them had wrong values.<br>
Those items with the wrong values at buy quantity and buy unit_price and ONLY there, as far as i saw, were fluctuating…so: <br>
one time the values are wrong…a few sec later, they were right again…but then again wrong…but mostly wrong(checked in browser and my program = same result). <br>
items with low mount of buy orders like 10 to 20 are mosty show the right value. It looks to me like the algorithem wich counts the number of buy orders and adds them to another, isnt getting done, till the object is send.<br>
My theorie, thats how it looks to me.)</p></p>

<p>Hmm. I’ll continue investigating; I’m pretty sure that this isn’t an API issue at least — the backend servers that handle the trading post were responding with that exact data. My suspicion is that there’s a cache coherency bug somewhere in the trading post servers that causes them to occasionally return erroneous data to both the game and the API.</p></p>

<p>I started having an issue with incorrect coord locations for the tile service for the WvW Continent (id: 2) about 2 days ago for a website I’m in the works of making. I figured that it was a self-created bug since I had done a bit of work on it the day before.</p>
<p>Upon further investigation, it appears to happen to the JS fiddle example on the wiki as well:</p>
<p><a href="http://jsfiddle.net/CRRGC/1092/">http://jsfiddle.net/CRRGC/1092/</a></p>
<p>Notice that the points of interest are positioned correctly, but it looks like the map its self has zoomed in.</p>
<p>The issue appears to have come and gone over the past 2 days, with it being fixed for a few hours then incorrect again a few hours later. It also appears to be different at varying zoom-levels.</p>
<p>Has something changed?</p>
<p>Thanks,<br>

<p>Max zoom of the WvW map is now 6 (instead of 7). It’s best not hardcoding this (like in the example) but use the values returned from <a href="https://api.guildwars2.com/v2/continents/2">https://api.guildwars2.com/v2/continents/2</a>.</p></p>

Unfortunately the API seems to be switched off completely.<br>
Calling <a href="https://api.guildwars2.com/v2">https://api.guildwars2.com/v2</a> brings only a {"error": “not found”}.</p>

<p>@Markus: The game servers were offline because of the rollback (<a href="https://forum-en.guildwars2.com/forum/game/gw2/Rollback-details/first">more info</a>), and the API had to be taken down too.</p>

<p>
<p>Hi @ all,</p>
<p>i want to report a Bug within the specializations API  +  the image renderer.</p>
<p>Some specialization backgrounds are a little out of shape. <br>
For example <a href="https://render.guildwars2.com/file/B969F9B27EE82CBF0E4651FD0F760F702CB5FCED/1012101.png">https://render.guildwars2.com/file/B969F9B27EE82CBF0E4651FD0F760F702CB5FCED/1012101.png</a></p>
<p>you can see that there’s a large area of nothingness above and on the right side of the image itself.  Same here – <a href="https://render.guildwars2.com/file/6FCF0E0E0C0E539290A8245F0DA49D0556D71E62/1012110.png">https://render.guildwars2.com/file/6FCF0E0E0C0E539290A8245F0DA49D0556D71E62/1012110.png</a></p>
<p>This wouldn’t be a huge problem if the images would habe the same areas of nothingness around them, but for example <a href="https://render.guildwars2.com/file/992D53319C5FCD4AE841C592DC2AE91D5906AECF/1012057.png">https://render.guildwars2.com/file/992D53319C5FCD4AE841C592DC2AE91D5906AECF/1012057.png</a> is totally different – so a code based image cutting on my side is not really an option<img src="/include/images/smilies/sad.png"></p>
<p>could you maybe fix the images to get rid of all the empty space around them?</p></p>

<p>
<p>It’s still the same area that needs to be cropped, in your example the image just expands a little into the otherwise black/transparent part, but thats not visible ingame. The game internally renders them by upscaling the image to 1024×256px (if they are not already), then cropping it to the lower-left 647×136px.</p></p>

<p>Noticed the same since yesterday evening (here in UTC +1)  – Item Icons &amp; stuff are also broken but seem to come back step by step.</p>
<p>Edit: did a little debug-run and saw the foowing result:<br>
Request failed with code: 500<br>
java.io.IOException: Request failed with code: 500</p>
<p>Pretty strange, the images are loadable with my webBrowser but my Client(okhttp3)  gets an Error 500</p>
<p>Why can my browser display the images but okhttp quits its service on the same URL cal?</p></p>

<p>There are 20 items which are craftable (appear in the /recipes output_item_id field) but which have item identifiers which do not exist in the /items endpoint. The full list of these items and which recipes they come from are included in the attached TSV file.</p>
<p>Lawton, would you prefer additional bug reports to be posted here, posted as a separate thread, or should we skip this forum and directly create a Github issue (<a href="https://github.com/arenanet/api-cdi/issues">https://github.com/arenanet/api-cdi/issues</a>)?</p></p>

<p>It doesn’t matter too much for me — for whitelist issues it’s usually only a few minutes to fix, so I can just fix them as they come up. For anything larger, I’ll create a github issue one way or another so that I don’t totally forget about it.</p>
<p>Do whatever’s easiest for you. If you do open github issues, open separate issues for each batch of ids so I can close ‘em out and keep track of which I’ve done though.</p></p>

<p>Hmm, not actually a bug. Those recipes aren’t craftable by any disciplines.</p>
<p>I’ve gone ahead and un-whitelisted them; they might show back up since they’re technically auto-learned (e.g. every account should have them unlocked).</p></p>

<p>I brought this up for the GW2Efficiency developer, but according to <a href="https://github.com/gw2efficiency/issues/issues/714">him</a> it’s an error with the official API:</p>
<p>The dyes’ lightness value seems bugged, and not actually reflecting the lightness of the colours. It results in bugs like <a href="http://imgur.com/a/snSzE">this</a> ordering. I checked the numbers in Photoshop, and the colours indeed aren’t ordered correctly by either the lightness or the brightness values.</p></p>

<p>That achievement doesn’t have any data (name/description/etc), nor does it award any AP. It’s probably just a content artifact. There isn’t currently a way to blacklist achievements on the API, but if I had time I’d blacklist it so it’s not being returned from that endpoint.</p></p>
