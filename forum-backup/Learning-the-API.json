So, in search to find a way to really implement the API for mobile and web application use, I was hoping to create a forum here to talk specifically about where one might be able to learn how to use it. Of course, there is the <a href=\"http://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/API:Main\">Guild Wars 2 Wiki</a> where you can view the documentation, and there is also <a href=\"http://www.codecademy.com/\">Codecademy</a> which is a fantastic place to learn the basics of many different types of code.</p>\n<p>What I would like to do here is create a community based resource for novices and veterans can know where to start and get more specific information. Of course, there is YouTube and all that rubbish, but I want to find extremely helpful places to not just lecture but empower the learner to make his/her own iOS/Android/Web app. Now, if the YouTube video is really quite informative about a particular topic, please do feel to share. Even websites that help others to understand wrappers libraries and how to implement them would be helpful as well.</p>\n<p>Things are always changing in this game, and I think it’s important for us to collaborate in order to take advantage of the tools we already have rather than waiting for the <a href=\"http://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Extended_Experience\">‘Extended Experience’ app</a> to get here.</p>\n<p>Please, if you’re interested in participating, post a list of related sites to this thread as I’m about to do:</p>\n<ul>\n\t<li><a href=\"http://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/API:Main\">Guild Wars 2 Wiki: API</a> (API Documentation)</li>\n\t<li><a href=\"http://www.codecademy.com/\">Codecademy</a> (Learn the different coding languages)</li>\n</ul>","arenanet":false}]}
