I call it Plotty.<br>\nIt’s currently running as a small 3MB Windows system tray client, and when you toggle it on it checks the GW2 game’s Mumble interface to work out where you are in the world, who you are (curent character), and if you’re a commander.<br>\nAll the info is stored in a local SQLite db that you can query and export as CSV, and you can also map your data to a local interactive map.</p>\n<p>I’ve also added in the option to send your map data to a mapping server to plot your data publicly and collaboratively. The collaborative aspect of the mapping allows parties/guilds to see all their data in one map so for instance – if you like to WvW raid, you can do after-battle assessments to work out how well people stayed on tag etc.</p>\n<p>The Plotty client is independent of the mapping server, and if you’re a developer you can even make your own mapping server and have Plotty send data to it.</p>\n<p>I’ve only just released the tool – and there’s plenty of things that need improving both client side and on my mapping server. I’m hoping someone will find it useful/interesting.<img src=\"/include/images/smilies/wink.png\"></p>\n<p>Download from: <a href=\"http://gw2.properdave.com/plotty/latest\">http://gw2.properdave.com/plotty/latest</a></p>\n<p>Windows only at the moment. .Net 4 framework required.
