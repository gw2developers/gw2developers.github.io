It would be nice to have a place where we could suggest modifications to the API and features for the API as a whole. And here is the first one already:</p>\n<p>Presuming that a lot of the API data is cached on ArenaNet’s side (as there is a definite number of parameters and their values) and the results are not generated for every request individually, <strong>I would love to have a “last modified” header in the response</strong>.</p>\n<p>This would let us skip the checks for data changes and let us cache on our side more effectively.</p>\n<p>This would enable us to check for changes in server list and start up an extensive database update routines after content patches or other additions.</p>","arenanet":false}]}
