If there is a website which already displays the data, then they can instead write small scripts which will automate this, by basically requesting said website, and then parse the informations on this site.<br>\nThese are called Webcrawlers. They act kinda like a browser, just that instead of showing you a website, they will gather the data on this website and use the informations gathered. This comes with alot of bonus traffic for both sides (the website and the one requesting the information), as you will also get alot of unwanted informations which the webcrawler will just skip.<br>\nAlso such a webcrawler requires a bit of work to implement, and perhaps adjust when the layout of the website changes.</p>\n<p>And now we have this API.<br>\nIt allows a developer to request data in an easy to parse (aswell as kinda easy to read for humans) format. This format is called <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON\">JSON</a> .</p>","arenanet":false},{"pubDate":"2013-05-20T22:52:41.000Z","guid":"http://forum-en.guildwars2.com/forum/community/api/What-is-API/2064050","author":"Geotherma.2395","body":"\n<p>You can think of it like a living wiki, if it is happening in game the API or program that uses the API can view that.
