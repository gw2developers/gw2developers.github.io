<p>When we do wvw and we use a public teamspeak (or the like) to do wvw, we have no method of determining if a player should be allowed on the teamspeak; is he a spy or is he from our server?</p>
<p>Is it possible to make an api that supports:</p>
<p>string get_home_server(string player_id)</p>
<p>Argument player_id: the id or the name of a player.<br>
Returns: The name of the home server of the specified player.</p></p>

<p>
<p>I guess even anet isn’t able to reliable determine the home server of a player during WvW (Ya know, the strange server names of people in WvW…). However it’s at least possible to get the current world_id of a player who is NOT in WvW AND NOT in overflow via the <a href="/forum-backup/GW2-s-Mumble-Link-context-data-format">Mumble API</a>. The only reliable source for player info like that would (hopefully) be possible when the API finally supports OAuth and then delivers detailed data…</p></p>

<p>People will make their name a random pve player’s name to get around this.</p></p>

<p>On TC we use mumble.  People need to be registered to access the public WvW rooms.</p>
<p>Generally to get registered you have to meet somebody with the registration privilege in a WvW map to make sure they’re not just guesting.   Usually this is simply a case of asking in map chat.  Prominent guilds in WvW can register their own members.</p>
<p>It’s not perfect, still leaves problems when people transfer, but it’s about the best we can do right now.</p></p>

<p>+1 for this<br>
this isn’t about character information but about someones server assignment.<br>
Argument: Character Name/ Accountname<br>
Return value: server_id</p>
<p>Guess you’re an administrator of a voice chat for a guild or -in my case- a GW2 server community. Guess you want a proove that someone is playing on this GW2 server.</p>
<p>This little tool would solve all of our problems playing WvW without an “enemy” in the commanders voice chat channel.</p></p>

<p>But how would you know the person on voice chat is that character/account?</p>
<p>With our current system, at least we match the person asking for registration with an in-game request, with either obvious name associations or having them whisper their mumble username if it’s not so obvious.</p>
<p>I’m not sure a public API for a server_id will be an improvement at all.</p>
<p>What might work … create a web page people can visit, they login for authenticated API and home world is retrieved.  If it is the correct world they are presented with an access token they add to their mumble client which grants them access to the relevant rooms.  The token could be updated periodically.</p>
<p>The trick is, it has to be their actual home world returned, and not the last world they were on (guesting).</p></p>

<p>
<p>This is exactly what I’d code for this thingy Nabrok:</p>
<p>We already have several Web UIs matching the population of a map, the value and increase of its tick and the commander. All those features are just gimmicks.</p>
<p>An interface mapping the IP adress of the visitor to a voice chat user (TS3 in my case) is already done to grant access for a commander to those tools.</p>
<p>For this authorization a visitor has to enter his account name on a website, a script will check his home server and grant permission to the WvW voice chat channels (using servergroups).</p></p>

<p>
<p>There’s still need of this one:<br>
As this (and other) requests/ suggestions seem to be ignored, ppl started to create their own databases several months ago. E.g. using the mumble API (using character name, client IP, world-vs-world-map, color w. matchup data) and a small client connecting to central databases. (note: this is not! my! project)</p>
<p>You can’t be serious let that happen.</p></p>

<p>
<p>If you want to know someone’s home server, add them to your friends list and view your friends on the achievements leaderboards. The API is already there, it’s just not directly accessible.</p></p>

<p>Thanks for the response Pat. This is one of the API’s I look forward to the most because it opens up the door to WvW applications that can go beyond what we have seen in September’s Overwolf WvW competition.</p></p>

<p>So, how would you get the player id? Would you trust the person to enter it?</p>
<p>I know nothing about the GW2 api (sorry), I’m was just curious and passing by.</p>
<p>The only “proper” way to solve that issue would be for arenanet to have a kind of “social login” on other website, so that you would know for sure that the “playername.XXXX” is visiting your website, you could generate a token for him, and let him enter his token on your teamspeak server.<br>
Or alternatively, you could on the website (after the social login), let the user enter his teamspeak signature.</p></p>
