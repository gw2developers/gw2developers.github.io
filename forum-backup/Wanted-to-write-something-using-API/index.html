<p>
<p>But i’m SO restricted by it’s capabilities. So, i had a few ideas and after watching what API provides – NONE of them can be made. I can’t even start – there’s nothing for me.</p>
<p>First ideas – help our guild managers and other guilds by providing tools to control specific guild events, control active and non-active players, watch what players play PVE/PVP and what they’re doing and guide new players, connecting people by their in-game interests. And it’s just “first brainstorm”.</p>
<p>It’s so confusing to me – you’re even making contest for it – yet almost nothing can be done using tools you provide. The question is – will there be huge improvements to API in near future?</p>
<p>EDIT: <br>
Example of app that i would like to appear:<br>
Tool that watches the most active players in guild by category (for example, TOP5 Ascalon figthers), management of rewards.<br>
Another example:<br>
Synchronization code for web application to display game profile (our guild members should maintain this manually).</p></p>

<p>
<p>I looked a little more into your contest. I’m not the only one. Overwolf’s site with TOP ideas – almost all of them cannot be made.</p></p>

<p>
<p>So, in continuation of my monologue: it’s supposed to be a creative field. But i’m forced to do it the other way: look at your tools and force idea out of it, instead of making my own idea and looking for tools to do it.</p></p>

<p>In general a company doesnt have the need of developing any API because they dont take any profit from it. So as far as GW2 api is by now, its better than the api of most big games… Api development is in last place of everything</p></p>

<p>
<p>It’s not better. And directly there’s no profit. There’s no direct profit in making things like living story either. But community-driven games proven to exist much longer and attract more people. <br>
And if we’re comparing – there’s an API’s to huge games which far more better. I don’t know if i can use names, so i won’t.<br>
EDIT: And API development can be first. Depends on methods you use. Twitter use it’s own API, for example.</p></p>

<p>There are some plans for bigger improvements. See <a href="/forum-backup/API-CDI-2015">https:"https://github.com/arenanet/api-cdi">https://github.com/arenanet/api-cdi</a> (you can contribute as well!)</p>
<p>However they currently seem to rework the authentitication mechanism that is needed for a full qualified guild API. I guess this has a higher priority at the moment.</p>
<p>I agree with you that the API is limmited but I think it is better than nothing.</p></p>

<p>This is pretty much it; we’ve got a pile of stuff in the works, but it’s currently blocked by the new authentication bits. I know the functionality we provide today is currently very limited, but rest assured, we’re working on it.</p></p>

<p>They can already spy on you using the in-game functionality :P</p>
<p>One of my guild leaders even makes daily charts of his members to track in-game intra-guild engagement to determine how effective their events are and how often they need to run events to maximize turnouts. It’s a lot of manual labor to copy all of the data out of the game and into a spreadsheet. The API additions wouldn’t give any data that isn’t already available, it would just make it much, much easier to use.</p></p>

<p>i’d love to see player-written tools for guild management — much better than tasking ANet with developing such tools. Be great to see things like how many people show up for guild events (given time/location, how many people repping), which would allow GLs to plan/adapt accordingly.</p>
<p>And right now, as Mr Campbell says, people (including GLs or those on your /block list) can keep track of your AP, location, time spent in game. It’s just manual atm.</p>
<p>tl;dr good ideas, OP and thanks, LC, for updating the reasons why it won’t be available soon™. Please keep keeping us posted.</p></p>
