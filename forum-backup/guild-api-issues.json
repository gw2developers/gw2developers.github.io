I went to that account’s api section on the website and got an API key for account&amp;guild. Now if I try <a href=\"https://api.guildwars2.com/v2/guild/&lt;insertIdHere&gt;/log\">https://api.guildwars2.com/v2/guild/&lt;insertIdHere&gt;/log</a> , or any other /v2/guild endpoints; I always get the error “endpoint requires authentication”. I’ve checked my mails in case it was that but couldn’t find  anything… so how exactly do I go about ‘authenticating’ an API key that I generated?</p>\n<p>Many thanks for any clarification,</p>\n<p>Darqam</p>","arenanet":false}]}
