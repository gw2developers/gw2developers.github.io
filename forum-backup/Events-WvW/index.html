<p>
<p>Hello, thanks for finally share the API with community. Will be very useful.</p>
<p>The only thing I am looking for and may be missing yet is the WvW Events in the events.json api. I am right? One way to see if there any sword in the maps using map_id and world_id. Same for other events like mercenaries, keep contest, supply events, and others.</p>
<p>I am right? Because I cannot understand the explanation:</p>
<p><a href="https://api.guildwars2.com/v1/wvw/objective_names.json">https://api.guildwars2.com/v1/wvw/objective_names.json</a><br>
Optional parameter: lang<br>
These APIs return a JSON array of ids to strings. <strong>The ids correspond to ids returned in the events.json API.</strong></p>
<p>How we can find events from WvW in events.json?</p></p>

<p>
<p>At the moment, the events API only returns events for public maps. That means that instances, WvW, PvP and any other map types that may have events will not appear in the list.</p>
<p>We’re being careful with the information we release with the WvW API so that we don’t disrupt the balance of the game.</p></p>

<p>To get information about open fights or tower sieges and the locations would be very cool, so I could implement a map in the browser like in the game. So I could have the game opened in one monitor and the live wvw map in an other monitor. Is this something, you don’t want, when you actually don’t wanna tell us the wvw events at the moment?<img src="/include/images/smilies/smile.png"></p></p>

<p>How would you verify, that you are from the server/world which data you are viewing… presumably unless they implement private account level api keys for each individual account nothing like this would be possible.</p>
<p>I assume they do not want to expose the authentication “as is” to external applications (hence the api key would function as an auth, much like stream key/secret on twitch for example).</p></p>

<p>Why is in this idea an authentication necessary? I mean at the end, when I open the map all three servers of a match get the same information… And for other servers it isn’t relevant, because they can’t really “influence” other matches.<img src="/include/images/smilies/smile.png"></p></p>

<p>I don’t WvW that much… does enemy siege (ie. trebs) show on map, I know own does, for example…. Just towers and keeps probably don’t need it though. After all it wouldn’t show movement information, except through sentry status but that is public to all.</p>
<p>Edit: I probably thought too closely at the in-game map because it has plenty of server specific info, but now that I think about it, most of that wouldn’t be practical to be represented through an API like this anyways.</p></p>

<p>
<p>That’s right, treb icons will be displayed for the own team at your map, but this information isn’t really helpful, so I don’t need it in the api. I mentioned the keeps, which are contested or the battle crosses made by open field fights or by knocking at a keep’s gate, u know?<img src="/include/images/smilies/smile.png"></p></p>

<p>Do you have any plans to release data about contested points in WvW? Or would that cause the balance disruption you are talking about?</p></p>

<p>My own thoughts are that would probably disrupt the balance. As nice as it would be, being able to see what exactly is happening on a web based map when not logged in, that kind of information would make it very easy to create an AI sentry that alerts Mumble/Shoutboxes/etc when certain points are under attack, without needing someone keeping an eye on them.</p></p>
