The only way to get an idea of who it might have been is to go and check the v2/guild/:id/members list and then compare to a previously cached version of that list. If you’re dealing with a rogue officer that’s gone off the deep end, this can be a tedious problem to manage.</p>\n<p>If a user /gquits the guild, then there is simply an event that looks like the following.</p>\n<p>[{\"id\":xxx67,\"time\":\"2016-xx-xxT12:55:04.096Z\",\"type\":\"kick\"}]</p>\n<p>If the user is kicked from the guild, then the event does include the \"kicked_by\" property with the name of the officer or person that kicked them.</p>\n<p>[{\"id\":xxx63,\"time\":\"2016-xx-xxT14:40:08.081Z\",\"type\":\"kick\",\"kicked_by\":\"xxxxxxxx.xxxx\"}]</p>\n<p>If you later invite a person that was kicked/gquit then you can see both the \"user\" and \"kicked_by\" properties without issue.</p>\n<p>[{\"id\":xx77,\"time\":\"2016-xx-xxT22:55:11.096Z\",\"type\":\"kick\",\"user\":\"xxxxxxxx.xxxx\",\"kicked_by\":\"xxxxxxxx.xxxx\"}]</p>\n<p>Is there a way we can get the full details of the user and kicked_by properties for all instances of this event? It’d make managing a userlist a lot easier. Wouldn’t have to go pull the members list just to see who gquit/got kicked. Just update the already-cached members list locally.</p>","arenanet":false}]}
