I doubt we’ll see a gathering node API in the future as it could be easily exploited (think of the possibilities of the Mumble link data combined with the maps API and some sort of botting tool). I don’t think that Anet randomized the positions of gathering nodes just for fun…<img src=\"/include/images/smilies/wink.png\"></p>","arenanet":false},{"pubDate":"2014-02-17T06:49:16.000Z","guid":"http://forum-en.guildwars2.com/forum/community/api/API-Suggestion-Gathering-nodes-in-Maps-API/3648277","author":"YtseJam.9784","body":"\n<p>Any chance you could add the gathering nodes coordinates to the Maps API? There are some community developed projects out there that rely on community input, i.e. players go in and add the locations of the nodes they have found to a website. The problem with this is that we have to rely on other people’s input and most of the time the data is inaccurate. I would like these websites to post the nodes locations from official data from ANET’s API instead.</p>\n<p>Thanks,</p>\n<p>Itsy</p>","arenanet":false}]}
