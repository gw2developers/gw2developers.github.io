I’m using leaflet for the mapping API, and one of the marker cluster modules to relieve some of the client slowdown that might happen. The only POI information on the map are camps/towers/keeps, so that part is relatively low.</p>\n<p>My hosting service sounds comparable to yours, I was just concerned that I would have to find a place to host a custom C/C++ app and run it through CGI or something. Most web services frown on constantly running apps though, so I’m hoping to keep it entirely in the PHP/SQL space.

It’s ~260 uncompressed bytes per player in my example, which can be shrinked down to ~190 when you use single letters as JSON identifiers and store world/map names in a JSON and assign them on the client side – so a client would receive ~20kB of data for 100 players. It would be an idea to dynamically increase the map update interval with increasing player numbers if you get in trouble there.</li>\n\t<li>From my experience, Google Maps as well as leaflet will slow down at &gt; 250 markers or so shown on the map (depends on client hardware).  If you plan to show also the POIs from map_floor.json, you should not draw them but leave it up to the client to show/hide them.
