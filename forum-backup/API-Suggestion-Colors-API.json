Just look at the Deep Maple starter colour – it shows up as a reddish brown in terms of RGB values and so on, and sites show it is as such, but if you apply it to armour, you will see that in actuality, parts of the armour will be reddish brown, parts red, and parts green! Whereas if you apply a different reddish brown, say Caramel, or Clove, it will just dye the armour different shades of reddish brown (whether pale or deep, according to the armour). I can provide screenshots to illustrate this, if that’s helpful.</p>\n<p>So it’s clear that there is more going on with dyes in GW2 than merely the superficial/initial RGB and HSL values.</p>","arenanet":false},{"pubDate":"2013-09-26T04:59:34.000Z","guid":"http://forum-en.guildwars2.com/forum/community/api/API-Suggestion-Colors-API/2916091","author":"White Wolf.3291","body":"\n<blockquote><div class=\"citey\"><cite title=\"Posted on September 26 2013 01:55AM\"><a href=\"/forum/community/api/API-Suggestion-Colors-API/2915574\">Dr Ishmael.9685:</a></cite></div><div class=\"quotey\"><p>The wiki currently knows these properties for every dye in the game, but it would be convenient for non-wiki sites to have this data available from the API.</p></div></blockquote>\n<p>It’s still missing  the material for the new 6 dyes that were introduced with Tequatl’s Rising Patch and the only way to see it is buying the 6 dyes and sort them by Material in the Dye View (Hero Panel).</p>","arenanet":false},{"pubDate":"2013-09-26T01:55:01.000Z","guid":"http://forum-en.guildwars2.com/forum/community/api/API-Suggestion-Colors-API/2915574","author":"Dr Ishmael.9685","body":"\n<p>We’re talking about the groups that dyes are placed in by the in-game dye panel, where you can group them by hue, set, or material.</p>\n<ul>\n\t<li>Set is mostly based on the rarity.
