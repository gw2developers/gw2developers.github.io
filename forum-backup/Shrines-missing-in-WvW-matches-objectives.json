They’re just not referenced by the matches endpoint (nor do they have coordinates anymore since the sectors they were associated with were removed). It’s kind of a weird situation; we could filter them out but I can’t really think of a compelling reason to. It stands to reason that eventually we’ll want them back (if/when we switch back to the alpine borderlands).</p>","arenanet":true},{"pubDate":"2015-10-29T01:09:48.000Z","guid":"http://forum-en.guildwars2.com/forum/community/api/Shrines-missing-in-WvW-matches-objectives/5680793","author":"Freck.2168","body":"\n<p>The shrines are nowhere to be found in the API.
