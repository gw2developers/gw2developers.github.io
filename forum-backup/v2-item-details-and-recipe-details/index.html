<p>
<p>I can’t find any mention of how to get item_details or recipe_details with v2, do we still use v1?<br>
such as <a href="https://api.guildwars2.com/v1/recipe_details.json?recipe_id=200">https://api.guildwars2.com/v1/recipe_details.json?recipe_id=200</a></p>
<p>On a different topic, gem prices.  Why do the coins_per_gem change depending on the quantity requested?  I know they would change as the price changes, but this is too much, and is predictable (smaller the quantity, larger the price):<br>
<a href="https://api.guildwars2.com/v2/commerce/exchange/coins?quantity=10000000">https://api.guildwars2.com/v2/commerce/exchange/coins?quantity=10000000</a><br>
quantity_in_url = coins_per_gem<br>
10000000 = 1279<br>
1000000 = 1277<br>
100000 = 1279<br>
10000 = 1380<br>
8000 = 1502<br>
7000 = 1288<br>
6000 = 1341<br>
5000 = 1431<br>
4000 = 1610<br>
3000 = 2147</p>
<p>hmmmm. I decided to check the in-game gem exchange.  It looks like it costs 21s57c to buy 1 gem, and 2g16s12c to buy 17 gems (12s71c per gem).  I guess that explains why the api would give those numbers, but why does buying single-digit amounts of gems cost up to 70% more per gem than double-digit?</p></p>

<p>You can still use v1 for now. The data that v2 will return should be the same. Only the response format will be different. Consider converting incoming response data to custom class layouts that are reusable for v2 when that becomes available.</p></p>

<p>
<p>The /v2 api combines the /v1/items.json &amp; /v1/item_details.json APIs into a single, simpler API. You can look a /v2/commerce/listings for an example of the behavior. Requesting the root of /v2/items returns a list of all item IDs, exactly like /v1/items.json. You can then request for /v2/items/&lt;id&gt; or use any of the other querying mechanisms like ?ids=&lt;id&gt;,&lt;id&gt;,&lt;id&gt; or pagination to get individual item details.</p></p>

<p>Will the json schema for item details change at all? Or will it be the same as v1, but with added support for bulk requests and pagination?</p></p>

<p>Way more interesting would actually be the [item_type] part (hope you also changed the naming of that because it was a pain to “guess” the right identifier for that subobject).</p>
<p>Example:<br>

<p>Ok, I saw that the answer for my previous question is no, and I can understand why.</p>
<p>From your last example ( API v2), I can see that “suffix_item_id” is not present but “secondary_suffix_item_id” is present (but empty). I suppose that “suffix_item_id” is not present because Trinket don’t have a slot for rune/sigil, but why “secondary_suffix_item_id” is still present?</p></p>

<p>
<p>I’ve always wanted to know why an item’s combat attributes is a collection instead of an object. Don’t you store each attribute as a separate table column?</p>
<p>Can items have multiple inherent attributes of the same type? Even if so, why not add them together?</p>
<p>To clarify, this would make more sense to me:<br>
</p><pre><code>
"attributes": {
	"Power": 33,
	"Precision" : 33,
	"Toughness" : 33,
	"Vitality : 33,
	"Healing" : 33,
	"ConditionDamage" : 33,
	"CritDamage" : 33

Should this be the same list of items as /v1/items.json ?  Looks like v2/commerce/listings has 22,125 Items, while v1/items.json has 37,817 Items.</p>
<p>But <a href="https://api.guildwars2.com/v2/items/12138">https://api.guildwars2.com/v2/items/12138</a> just says "{"text":“API not active”}"<br>
same for <a href="https://api.guildwars2.com/v2/items?id=12138">https://api.guildwars2.com/v2/items?id=12138</a><br>
maybe it’s not implemented yet, or I’m reading the example wrong?</p></p>

<p>
<p>/commerce/listings only returns identifiers for items that are currently listed on the trading post. That explains why there are well over 15000 identifiers missing from the listing service.</p>
<p>What it doesn’t expain is why there are item identifiers in the listing service that are not in the items.json service?!</p>
<p>example:</p>
<p><a href="https://api.guildwars2.com/v2/commerce/listings/9102">https://api.guildwars2.com/v2/commerce/listings/9102</a><br>
<a href="https://api.guildwars2.com/v1/item_details.json?item_id=9102">https://api.guildwars2.com/v1/item_details.json?item_id=9102</a></p>
<p><strong>edit</strong></p>
<p>Mystery solved. You can place bids for that item on the trading post, but nobody actually has it. Only discovered items appear in the items service.</p></p>

<p>
<p>The /v2/items API doesn’t know about 9102 either. I wonder if the /v1 API feeding it hasn’t been updated correctly? Not something I’ve got a hand in so tough to answer.</p>
<p>/v2/items API isn’t active yet as we’re still polishing up some bits. I’m just providing examples to hopefully answer questions and maybe unblock folks that are writing libs that want to consume /v2 APIs.</p></p>

<p>It looks to me as if these items are not supposed to be listed on the trading post. I converted some of the identifiers to chat links and pasted them in-game to see what item they correspond to. Items include things like “Cinematic Weapon Sword Charr”.</p>

<p>There are actually a lot of questionable items on the TP. Items that are either soul- or account bound or like the one you discovered, items which are not meant for player use. Seems like there are (or hopefully “were”) a couple of bugs in there so that one could list invalid items – most likely through “inofficial” TP API use.</p></p>

<p>Yeah, we chatted about it some internally and have a hypothesis. There was a bug around launch that let you place buy orders for items before they’d ever been “discovered” (sold). Folks were using our unsupported web service endpoints in the TP to place buy orders by incrementing item IDs blindly, so there’s all sorts of weird gunk on there now.</p>
<p>Commerce team is looking at how hard it’d be to clean that stuff up because it’s just cluttering things and making for weird situations like this. Since those items have never been discovered in-game (unsurprising, given that they’re internal-only NPC things) the items endpoint doesn’t know anything about them. That disconnect sucks, so we’d like to clean it up.</p></p>

<p>We could expose the commerce search endpoint, but it only knows about items that can be put on the Trading Post. We don’t have any other search backends wired up to items that I’m aware of.</p></p>

<p>This would be helpful too – at least for people who want to build their own TP listings.<img src="/include/images/smilies/colondee.png"></p>
<p>Anyway, having an “own” database makes it easier to play around and keep track of changes. That being said: any chance on an endpoint which lists the ids of changed items after a patch has been pushed?</p></p>

<p>Thanks for the heads up!<br>
I wonder how that process would be easier with v2 since it basically delivers the same data. Currently the only way to find and update changed items is to retrieve the info for each and every item over and over. So the only advantage of v2 will be the bulk request which may speed up this process (which currently takes about a day).</p>

<p>That’s what I’m referring to, yes. Getting back 200 items at a time is going to speed up that process.</p></p>

<p>The only way this information would make sense with each request would be for the item details, like build_introduced and build_changed so that we could keep track of these. But i guess thats over the top anyway…<img src="/include/images/smilies/colondee.png"></p></p>

<p>I’m a little paranoid about the build number changing while I’m updating my database. My workflow now is to get the build number, then retrieve a batch of items, then verify that the build number hasn’t changed. Only if the build hasn’t changed can I be sure that each item was assigned the correct build identifier. If it did change, I have to discard that batch.</p></p>

<p>I’ll think about it, but it’s not going to be a high priority compared to getting the rest of the /v2 APIs enabled.</p></p>

<p>The bottleneck here at the moment is the completion of the request.  If you thread your requests it goes significantly faster.  The script that builds the recipe list for my website grabs every individual recipe(num_recipes/10_x_num_procs at a time), and (currently 7228) craftable item details in 4 languages.  And completes in about 3-5 minutes depending on network traffic.</p>

<p>Threading is the bomb.  I’m currently running on my work laptop – not the most powerful beast in the world (Core i5-3210M @ 2.50 GHz), but the LAN has very fat bandwidth.  I’m using my custom Perl module posting to a MySQL database.</p>
<ul>
	<li>My original single-threaded version took about 7 hours to process all items back when we only had 30k of them.</li>
	<li>A few months ago I rewrote it to fork 4 child threads to process items in parallel, and this version only takes about 2 hours with 38k items now.</li>

<p>I was tempted to say thats hard to do in PHP due to the lack of multi threading, but hey, it isn’t (there is an extension but it’s nothing to rely on: <a href="http://php.net/pthreads">http://php.net/pthreads</a>). I built the updater around this example: <a href="https://gist.github.com/Xeoncross/2362936">https://gist.github.com/Xeoncross/2362936</a> and it looks promising – ok, it isn’t multi threaded but at least asynchronous.</p></p>

Just did a couple test runs with 1000 requests (250 items) which have been completed in ~72 seconds on a very slow connection, would be in total about 3 hours, assuming 38k items (152k requests).</p></p>

<p>
<p>How many requests out of 1000 does it send and post-process at a time? Would you be able to queue up all 1000 requests at the same time, then handle each one as it completes?</p>
<p>My understanding is that the total duration should approach the sum of (the time it takes to queue all requests) plus (the time of the slowest HTTP query). How does it still take over a minute? (honest question)</p></p>

<p>
<p>I’ve tested it and it’d be able to do so. But there’s 2 problems:</p>
<p>first: it’ll blow up your cpu and memory<br>
second: there may be a limit of concurrent connections to the same host or you might get blocked when you’re hammering too hard, so there’s a limit which you can specify</p>
<p>The first example which i’ve posted works basically like that – no limits, just hammering. The one Pat posted has those limitations built in, one might use this for production.</p>
<p>Y U EDIT WHILE I ANSWER?<img src="/include/images/smilies/colondee.png"></p>
<p>The total duration is just approx, mileage may vary. I’m currently rewriting my database updater, so i can maybe give you real results tomorrow.</p></p>

<p>Forget about /v1, show us the numbers for /v2/items. The new APIs seem fast enough to not require asynchronous code, but I’m curious to see how far it can be pushed.</p></p>

Darthmaim’s server has at least a 1Gbit connection (if not 10Gbit+) – not much of a problem there.</p>
<p>(WIP already on github: <a href="https://github.com/codemasher/gw2-database/blob/master/classes/gw2items.class.php#L156">https://github.com/codemasher/gw2-database/blob/master/classes/gw2items.class.php#L156</a>)</p></p>
