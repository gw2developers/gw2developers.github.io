Supply is stored in the character blobs which the API can only access with 5-minute granularity — so it’s almost never going to be up-to-date. This constraint is so that the API can’t affect any other game system performance-wise (so it’ll probably never be lifted). Because of that, it’s unlikely that we’ll be able to have a v2 endpoint that’ll match your use-case.</p>\n<p>Sorry <img src=\"/include/images/smilies/sad.png\"></p>","arenanet":true},{"pubDate":"2015-09-26T21:15:41.000Z","guid":"http://forum-en.guildwars2.com/forum/community/api/Squad-endpoint/5533773","author":"smiley.1438","body":"\n<p>The problem is the same as with realtime positional data. It takes some time to get a snapshot of the client state and transfer this data to the API. Thus, realtime supply count through the API is moot and so are all it’s applications (i heard there may be websockets access at some point in the future). You need to know the exact supply count on demand at any time – not the data of 30+ seconds ago (your squad repaired the gate while the enemy’s ram was still up, right?<img src=\"/include/images/smilies/colondee.png\">).</p>","arenanet":false},{"pubDate":"2015-09-26T20:57:42.000Z","guid":"http://forum-en.guildwars2.com/forum/community/api/Squad-endpoint/5533722","author":"TorquedSoul.8097","body":"\n<p>Trying to avoid having players install any additional software.
