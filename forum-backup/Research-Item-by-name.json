But i’m currently trying to use the v2 API and i’d like to search an item by is name and not is ID.</p>\n<p>Is there a way to do so in the official API, i don’t want to use a third party project or anything ?</p>\n<p>I’d like have a searchbox in my app, in order to search the item on the API. I’ve searched in this forum but latests informations on the subject were 2 years ago, i’ve searched also on wiki, and changelog, but changelog file was also updated 2 or 3 years ago.</p>\n<p>Thanks for answering, and one more time really sorry for disturbing you.</p>","arenanet":false}]}
