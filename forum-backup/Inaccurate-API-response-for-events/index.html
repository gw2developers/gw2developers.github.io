<p>
<p>So, I’m trying to create a small webapp that determines which temples are open on which servers. I thought that I could use the event.json API with the event_id parameter, but the responses I’m getting are inaccurate.</p>
<p>At first, I was calling to check the last event in the meta-event chains, and if it was listed as <strong>Success</strong>, then I assumed the temple was open. However, I was getting <strong>Success</strong> for some temples that were currently closed.</p>
<p>Then, I thought that maybe the <strong>Success</strong> state stays until the event loops back around and is changed to <strong>Active</strong>, so I thought I’d instead check all the events in the specific event chains for <strong>Success</strong>, but that doesn’t work either. For some reason, a temple that is currently open on Yak’s Bend (Melandru) is showing <strong>Fail</strong> for one or two of the events in the event chain.</p>
<p>So, my question to the devs is: How can we accurately check that a temple is currently open on a particular server?</p></p>

<p>
<p>The API is very confusing for while.</p>
<p>I code an script to log every event change for all dragon events and store in my files for personal analysis. The result can be seen here: <a href="http://guildwars2brasil.com.br/eventtimer/report_test.html">http://guildwars2brasil.com.br/eventtimer/report_test.html</a></p>
<p>I am trying to write an timer app, but I can’t understand any pattern in the timers. For now I am logging a bit more trying to see anything.</p></p>

<p>
<p>Every event works differently and some may or may not use the proper flags. Some events may finish with a success state while others finish with a warmup state. Neither will tell you if they’re complete. The only generic solution is to constantly check for an active state and then remember if it was successfully completed or failed.</p>
<p>For the temples, the state of their defense events should give an idea of the state (for example, dwayna: 0723E056-E665-439F-99B7-20385442AD4E). A failed defense event means the temple was not captured.</p></p>

<p>
<p>I think there is a bug with the status reported by meta events and I don’t trust their current reported status at the moment until the next game patch.</p>
<p>But I’ll be interested to know how this turns out since I am interested to do the same thing.</p></p>

<p>
<p>Thanks for all the responses, guys. I suppose the defense event would make the most sense in that as long as it’s not reporting ‘fail’, the temple should be open.</p>
<p>Still, the fact that I’m getting ‘fail’ for some of the events in the chain that are required for the temple to be open despite the temple currently being open seems to indicate that there is a bug in events and their states are not being saved properly.</p></p>

<p>To be a little more specific, if the defense event is in warmup, the temple should be open. If the event is failed the pre-event should be resetting. If the event is active, the temple is being taken back, which would then progress to either failed or back to warmup.</p></p>

<p>Anyone knows what is the defense event for the Temple of Balthazar?</p>
<p>Let’s compile a list of Defense events for the Orr temples so we can verify this.  These are my untested “best guess” picks, so please correct me if I am wrong:</p>
<p>“0723E056-E665-439F-99B7-20385442AD4E”; // “Protect the Cathedral of Zephyrs.” – Dwayna</p>
<p>“0372874E-59B7-4A8F-B535-2CF57B8E67E4”; // “Kill the Corrupted High Priestess” – Lyssa</p>
<p>“989A298C-B06B-4E9B-A871-1506A6EE3FEC”; // “Defend the Pact interrupter from Risen attacks.” – Melandru</p>
<p>“DFBFF5FE-5AF0-4B65-9199-B7CACC945ABD”; // “Ensure that the Pact holds the Gates of Arah.” – Arah</p>
<p>“57A8E394-092D-4877-90A5-C238E882C320”; // “Stop the Risen Priest of Grenth from retaking the Cathedral of Silence.” – Grenth</p></p>

<p>Thanks, for the US servers these are the ones that have a non-fail status right now:</p>
<p>Dragonbrand Warmup<br>
Northern Shiverpeaks Warmup</p>
<p>Unfortunately, I used up my daily Guesting limit so I can’t peek at these servers.  Perhaps someone else can check if the Temple of Balthazar is opened there?</p></p>

<p>I tried it again and using this defense event appears to work at the Temple of Balthazar.  If the event status is not Fail, then the temple should be clear.  At the moment, Tarnished Coast has the status marked as Warmup and the temple is cleared.</p>
<p>If we can compile a list of all the relevant events for each temple and dungeon, we should be able to know which servers have them available at any time.</p></p>
