<p>With the new WvW maps coming are there any API changes ?<br>
It would be nice to change existing applications ahead of time.</p></p>

<p>
<p>Not sure, been flailing around trying to get the authenticated APIs out and working. If there are any changes, we’ll post them in the <a href="https://github.com/arenanet/api-cdi/pulls">CDI Github Repo</a> with a “Breaking Change” tag.</p>
<p>I suspect that we’ll be adding more stuff to <code>/v2/wvw/objectives</code> and put map IDs or something into <code>/v2/wvw/matches</code> so you can display the correct map (EDIT: err, maybe s/v2/v1/; I am posting pre-coffee)</p></p>

<p>Bloodlust doesn’t appear to be a part of the new map?  So I guess that part would not be useful anymore … at least until we see how you plan on reusing alpine.</p>
<p>Honestly, I’m not looking forward to grabbing the icons (I still haven’t updated mine from the old blue color) and figuring out co-ordinates for all the objectives again.  Any chance that stuff could at least be documented, if not part of the API itself?</p>
<p>Although I have been considering dropping the actual map and going for a more abstract display that clearly shows supply lines.</p>
<p>Oh … as sentries are gonna get a buff and become more important, any chance those could be added to the API?</p></p>

<p>You know as much as I do at this point, I’ve read on reddit there’ll be some kind of rotation? So it makes sense to ensure that the format works for both the new and old maps.</p>
<p>The new map has some kind of timed event thing; it’d be really nice to include the timer in the response as well so the countdown could be displayed.</p>

<p>I want the objective coordinates to one day be in the API. I really want to gut how the WvW endpoints work and make the <code>/v2/wvw</code> endpoints much more usable, but the authenticated endpoints are currently eating up all my time.</p>

<p>IMO the sentry status would be really nice to see, whether or not they get a buff.</p></p>

<p>Hah, that’s kind of funny.  I think the most recent info is that it will replace alpine completely with alpine coming back for tournaments in some capacity.</p>
<blockquote><div class="quotey"><p>The new map has some kind of timed event thing; it’d be really nice to include the timer in the response as well so the countdown could be displayed.</p></div></blockquote>
<p>While we’re talking about timers … how about the time of the next score tick?</p>

<p>That would be great, but I agree that the authenticated endpoints are more important.  I unleashed my app on the world today and it seems to have been well received.  If you happen to play on TC you’ll see it in action if you use the server voice comms.</p>
<p>Looking forward to the guild list being added, there’s some cool stuff I could do with that.</p></p>

<p>Yeah, that’d be really useful too.</p>
<p>I really need to sit down and draft an initial proposal for the /v2/wvw endpoints.</p>

<p>All the objectives should have a time stamp when the last ownership change occurred.</p></p>

<p>Mumble.  We have a bot that sends a text message when an unregistered user logs in with a link to a website.  When they click the link it checks a couple things like their username is formatted correctly and gives a landing page with a brief description.</p>
<p>They click a button there to authenticate, and if they’re on TC the mumble bot is sent a signal and register the person.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, at the moment the bot host is having some connectivity issues with the mumble server.   Typical … the bots been running for months (it does other stuff as well) with no problems.</p></p>
