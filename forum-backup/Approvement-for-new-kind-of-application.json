It makes use of the GW2 api in combination with the mumble link. The result is an application that shows objective information ‘hovering’ over the actual objectives in-game. Some of the users I have let me know they would like some kind of verification about the legality of the overlay, so hereby I would like to ask you, developers at ArenaNet, is it allowed to make this kind of use of the tools you give me? Here’s a link to the application’s website for details: <a href=\"http://www.gw2battlesupport.com\">http://www.gw2battlesupport.com</a></p>","arenanet":false}]}
