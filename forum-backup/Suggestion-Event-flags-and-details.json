Especially group events and skill challenges should be marked. Something like “flags”:“G”, “flags”:“S”, “flags”:“G,S” for example. Other possible flags could maybe be for pre-events and events giving chests?</p>\n<p>I’d also (as many other threads mention) like to see a timestamp for last status change<img src=\"/include/images/smilies/smile.png\"></p>\n<p>Last (for now), I’d like to see an event_details api, that could list some more information about an event. More text, maybe a general location. And for example for active events, it could list the event progress and goal name(s).</p>","arenanet":false}]}
