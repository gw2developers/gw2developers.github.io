Sometimes it happens that a dragon (fire elemental) is down within 1 minute.. This means that when I check its on success… few seconds after the event starts and goes to active… 40/50 seconds later the elemental is down and 10 seconds alter I check again and its already on success… <br>\nThis way there is no way I can check (without checking almost every 20/30 seconds (which will increase server load a lot) for accurate timers.</p>\n<p>I hope you can add this to the API so we can create better Timers for certain events!</p>","arenanet":false}]}
