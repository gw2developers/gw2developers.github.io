<p>Sorry to snipe that post, Lawton :P</p>
<p>(i got something wrong and found out now…<img src="/include/images/smilies/colondee.png">)</p>
<p>€€: ok, one thing about the “bonuses” object: shouldn’t it be an array of arrays in case more bonuses are being added or will bloodlust be the only one for the future?</p>
<p>€€€: Wait, does that even make sense? Maybe i should go to bed.</p>

<p>
<p>The center event status of the desert borderlands map should probably go into the bonuses array, and maybe EB merc camps. I wasn’t able to get that state plumbed through in time for HoT, but want to have that in the future. They’ll go in as objects into the bonuses array.</p>
<p>But yeah, this is using a bunch of new code (the implementation is parallel to the old one) to support a handful of new features. Had a rough time testing it in my dev environment, so I wanted to mess with it a bit more before announcing it. If you’re into early releases, <a href="https://api.guildwars2.com/v2/achievements/daily">you might also like this</a>. Not sure it behaves correctly at daily reset though.</p>

<p>I’m not the achievements guy, but i’m eager to play with the new wvw API as soon™ as possible.</p>
<p>Thanks for all the work btw!<img src="/include/images/smilies/wink.png"></p>
<p>€: Umm, now that we have that nice API, would it be possible to enable a bulk endpoint like /v1/guild_details? Would be 2 requests to get the whole data for a match – a dream!</p>
<p>€€: it would be even cooler if /v2/matches would contain a comma separated string of all guild IDs contained in the current response, which could then be used to get the guild data without looping through the response first.</p></p>

<p>Hmm, adding in the unauthenticated guild bits shouldn’t be a problem — the authenticated ones are fairly bitrotted at this point (been holding off until the expansion dust settles a bit before I fix ‘em up). I’ll look into adding a bulk-expanded unauthenticated /v2/guilds next week.</p>
<p>Probably not gonna provide a comma-separated list of guilds though  :P</p></p>

<p>Hi Lawton,</p>
<p>FYI, kills/deaths seem to be broken for EU matchups. The overall kill/death stats are not present at all, and the per-map stats all report as “0”.</p></p>

<p>/v1/wvw/matches without any id passed in gives me the world ids of the worlds involved in the match, whereas /v2/wvw/matches just gives the ids.</p>
<p>Should I just continue to use v1 to find the match that my world is in, or will that also be added to v2?</p></p>

<p>That functionality should still work in v1. I’ll probably add similar functionality to v2 (as a separate endpoint), though it isn’t there yet.</p></p>

<p>Hello Lawton,</p>
<p>the new kill/death counter is an awesome functionality,but the data stream seems to be inconsistent. While <em>some</em> of the data is added to the API value continuously, a big part of it seems to be gathered only every 4 hours. Is this the intended behavior or a bug?</p>
<p>As an example, I recorded the following on Saturday from 5PM GMT onwards: <a href="http://imgur.com/9AMrOvN">http://imgur.com/9AMrOvN</a></p>
<p>Edit: After looking more carefully at the map-wise breakdown of the kill counter, I’m fairly certain the calculation of the total kill/death count is bugged. For some of the values, the sum of the values for each map does not match the total.<br>
At present, the total tier 1 blue deaths listed are 50% higher than the combined deaths from all the maps.<br>
Given that the totals are making large unexplainable jumps and the map values are increasing smoothly, I’m assuming the issue lies with the combined numbers.</p></p>

<p>That feature works by listing to the event log of the WvW coordination server — there’s a lot of places where there could be a bug. It should be noted that the event log system is best-effort: during periods of high load messages might be dropped. It’s entirely possible that we’re just losing a lot of messages.</p>

<p>The sums probably won’t match up — you’ll have more deaths than kills due to NPCs killing players. 50% seems a bit high though, something’s probably wrong somewhere.</p>
<p>Sorry for the issues with this, won’t be able to fix them until some time after launch.</p></p>

<p>Maybe Jade Quarry is just really bad at clearing camps<img src="/include/images/smilies/smile.png"><br>
But in the limited data I have recorded, all these strange deaths have been accredited to another server.</p>
<p>Don’t worry too much about it, though.<br>
As I mentioned, the total is the only part showing strange behaviour. As far as I can tell, purely based on their progression, the map-specific values appear to be good.</p></p>

<p>So there was just recently (about 30 mins ago) a weird hiccup where the matches API errored out, and then suddenly the last_flipped time of every objective reset itself.  Not sure if it’s something to be too concerned about or not, but I thought you guys might want to know.  Also, it does seem to timeout at a fairly regular interval as well.</p></p>

<p>
<p>Hmm, sounds like the backend server crashed and/or was restarted. The last flipped data is only tracked in-memory; I may need to serialize that out to disk.</p>
<p>(EDIT: Wasn’t a crash/restart. Looking deeper).</p></p>
