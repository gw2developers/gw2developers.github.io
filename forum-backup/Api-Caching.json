I’m not too savvy about graphics stuff, but from my understanding the engine can’t do any software rasterizing — it needs an actual render context — which in Windows I guess means running as an application rather than a service. The render service currently runs as a windows service.</p>\n<p>So before we can get pretty character renders we need to either integrate a software rasterizer into the engine or figure out how to deploy the render stuff wildly differently from all our other backend services. I don’t personally have the technical chops to do either of these in a timely fashion, so it’s a bit tricky to tell when it’ll be workable.</p>\n<blockquote><div class=\"citey\"><cite title=\"Posted on August 03 2015 08:43AM\"><a href=\"/forum/community/api/Api-Caching/5344556\">stress level zero.4907:</a></cite></div><div class=\"quotey\"><p>As well as, what are the chances of adding what current specializations/talents a character has to the character api?</p></div></blockquote>\n<p>This is a fairly high priority on my todo list; I think I can have it ready for the patch after the next patch (but no promises; I haven’t figured out where that data’s stored yet).</p>","arenanet":true},{"pubDate":"2015-08-03T08:43:55.000Z","guid":"http://forum-en.guildwars2.com/forum/community/api/Api-Caching/5344556","author":"stress level zero.4907","body":"\n<p>Fair enough.
