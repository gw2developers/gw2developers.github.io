<p>
<p>So, multi-part…</p>
<p>1.   maybe asked before, but I have noticed many applications using some anet images/icons that are found on the official wiki. I was trying to look into using some as well, but I thought that the Terms said that they cannot be… Does this TOS just mean they cant be used maliciously or something?</p>
<p>2.  Specifically, the API lacks a few images that are useful (like PvP rank images, race icons, crafting icons[other than the small map icons], mastery point icon [earned and not], and many others that I am sure I will remember after posted this). These images are readily available on the wiki and are used by other applications, but I wanted to be sure before releasing my own application</p>
<p>3.  Obviously written permission would bypass this, but if that really a thing? I highly doubt these applications have gotten such permissions (maybe I am wrong…)</p>
<p>4.  If this isn’t possible, is there a way to request images to be added to the v2/files/ endpoint other than listing them sparsely through forum/github posts?</p>
<p>Thanks for the info in advance !<img src="/include/images/smilies/smile.png"></p></p>

<p>Having separate github issues for each bundle of file requests is the easiest way for me to keep track of things. I’ll toss all your requests onto <a href="https://github.com/arenanet/api-cdi/issues/220">this issue</a> since I haven’t started rooting around for the last batch yet.</p></p>

<p>For #1 and #3, the Content ToU (there’s a link to it if you navigate to the GW2 asset kit page under the Media navbar up top) provides sufficient “written permission” so long as you follow the parameters set forth within the ToU:</p>
<blockquote><div class="quotey"><p>Guild Wars 2 Content Terms of Use<br>

It is your responsibility to check these Content Terms of Use periodically for changes.

<p>Bolding is from the page, just had to add formatting. Anyways, basically, as long as you arent selling the application (a donation button is a verrrrrrry hazy gray area that Gaile Gray would likely know, or can get the answer to quickly), provide proper attribution to the source, and not imply it’s anything “official,” Anet generally wont care. Lawton’s probably the same, until you try to make a program that sends billions of requests for every iota of information available from the api server about Grumble Cakes.</p>
<hr>
<p>Yes, I’m aware this is an old thread, but the information added bears mentioning, as it’s still a valid concern for others than the OP.</p>
<p>edit: apparently three consecutive *’s are considered a “page break” and it gives a full width dividing line. Huh. Neat.</p></p>
