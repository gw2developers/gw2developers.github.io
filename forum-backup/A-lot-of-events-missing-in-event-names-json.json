The safest way would be to do something like tagging each event with a last seen date, recording what build the game is currently at, then after X amount of days, if the build is still the same, then chances are what the list now shows is all the events. It could still be possible though that some super rare event only gets completed once a month.</p>\n<p>But actually though, events don’t get deleted, because nothing gets deleted anymore. They’re just flagged to never activate and unlinked.</p>\n<p>As for the event with no name,</p>\n<blockquote><div class=\"citey\"><cite title=\"Posted on May 21 2013 11:17PM\"><a href=\"/forum/community/api/Nameless-Event/2070351\">Cliff Spradlin.3512:</a></cite></div><div class=\"quotey\"><p>OK, I talked to the designer in charge of that map, and she told me that it’s just a bug.

(sorry I didn’t answer earlier, was in a hurry last day).</p>\n<p>It seems like the events_names.json is repopulated after each update depending on events that are re-discovered. <br>\nThis is an issue : I don’t understand why this API needs a full reset. Reference APIs (world names, event names, map names) should be reliable at any moment, and static except when new events are added.</p>\n<p>I worked-around the issue by changing my event names retrieval batch from full replace to incremental; but now how can I know when an event doesn’t exist anymore in the game ? Since the api resets, what’s the difference between a removed event and an event that has not been re-discovered since last build ?</p>\n<p>As of now, 18 events did not reappear at all in event_names.json : <br>\n00E94E02-E3DD-4BB4-B2B9-2E07477748FF<br>\n05C26499-1FA8-438C-A8D0-CB6FD48B7091<br>\n07907625-D51C-4DB2-BDC2-7BC00BBCF82D<br>\n1A0AC9FE-D08B-46D4-95F3-6569372AF3D4<br>\n3126830C-9539-486A-B7FC-2B5CEEF672FD<br>\n4D9F9882-73E0-4639-A671-FFC6B2BB2A2C<br>\n57B63C51-0AA2-4894-ACED-CD3B4D49700F<br>\n58BAEF25-60FB-4FAC-87C8-C55F218FBBF8<br>\n5FAE9119-8F94-4FF7-A272-43ACEBE54534<br>\n66A0DAD5-DF69-45C2-97E7-BFC01B5D55BB<br>\n6D1DE9F0-5D4A-4B60-9C7F-FD81E9120D65<br>\n706BC94E-106B-496E-BC59-AF8DD5CD419A<br>\n87695E71-9D9A-496C-BBFA-FA6E62F16B39<br>\nA78ADABD-4C07-4321-A13F-CA6C69E442DC<br>\nB5BB0A76-715D-4AD7-A781-1A3C8426ABD0<br>\nB9E9BF38-A1A2-4D1C-86A7-184E1FEF8155<br>\nBD744CEC-DE53-4A83-B621-2FEAD5B546EE<br>\nCA56D651-5266-4937-A69D-767394BD8DC9</p>\n<p>Also, 1 event appears in event_names.json, but is missing its name  :<br>\n6BD7C8B0-2605-4819-9AE6-EF2849098090<br>\nWhat is this event ?
