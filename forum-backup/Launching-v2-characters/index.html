<p>
<p>Just turned on the first half of another authenticated endpoint — /v2/characters. This endpoint provides the non-inventory-related bits detailed in <a href="https://github.com/arenanet/api-cdi/pull/16">this pull request</a>, and requires an API key with “characters” permission from the person whose data you want to access.</p>
<p>Some examples — it basically works in the same manner as most of the other endpoints. The base URL returns a list of all the account’s character names:</p>
<pre><code>    GET /v2/characters HTTP/1.1
    Authorization: Bearer &lt;api-key&gt;

    HTTP/1.1 200 OK
    Content-Type: application/json

    [ "Logan Thackeray", "Eir Stegalkin"]
 
</code></pre>
<p>You can retrieve individual character blobs by putting them in the next URL component (or in a comma-delimited <code>ids</code> query parameter). Also note that you can pass the API key via the <code>access_token</code> query parameter if you’re making CORS requests (rather than setting the <code>Authorization</code> header):</p>
<pre><code>    GET /v2/characters/Logan%20Thackeray?access_token=&lt;api-key&gt;

    HTTP/1.1 200 OK
    Content-Type: application/json

    {
        "name": "Logan Thackeray",
        "race": "Charr",
        "gender": "Male",
        "profession": "Guardian",
        "level": 80,
        "guild": "4BBB52AA-D768-4FC6-8EDE-C299F2822F0F"
    }
 
</code></pre>
<p>Alternatively, you can make paginated requests. Metadata about the pagination details (e.g., the number of pages/results that can be requested) is returned in the response headers for ease-of-use.</p>
<pre><code>    GET /v2/characters?page=0&amp;page_size=50 HTTP/1.1
    Authorization: Bearer &lt;api-key&gt;

    HTTP/1.1 200 OK
    Content-Type: application/json
    Link: &lt;/v2/characters?page=0&amp;page_size=50&gt;; rel=self, &lt;/v2/characters?page=0&amp;page_size=50&gt;; rel=first, &lt;/v2/characters?page=0&amp;page_size=50&gt;; rel=last
    X-Page-Size: 50
    X-Page-Total: 1
    X-Result-Count: 2
    X-Result-Total: 2

    [
        {
            "name": "Logan Thackeray",
            "race": "Charr",
            "gender": "Male",
            "profession": "Guardian",
            "level": 80,
            "guild": "4BBB52AA-D768-4FC6-8EDE-C299F2822F0F"
        },
        {
            "name": "Eir Stegalkin",
            "race": "Sylvari",
            "gender": "Female",
            "profession": "Thief",
            "level": 80
        }
    ]
 
</code></pre>
<p>Right now the information returned is fairly basic, but we’ll be adding in the ability to pull character inventories, equipment, traits and skills later on.</p>
<p>Due to technical constraints (wibbly wobbly distributed systems) the character blobs may be a bit stale (up to 5 minutes, I think), so factor that in if you’re making a guild rep tracking system or something (because I know someone’s going to do that).</p>
<p>Let me know if you’ve got any questions/concerns and I’ll do my best to answer ’em.</p></p>

<p><a href="https://api.guildwars2.com/v2/characters?access_token=API_KEY">https://api.guildwars2.com/v2/characters?access_token=API_KEY</a> works fine</p>
<p>&amp;ids=all also doesn’t work… would be fine though.</p></p>

<p>That’s super weird, they should all be working. Can you PM me the API key you’re using?</p>

<p>Uhhh no comment.</p>
<p>WRT the ErrPermission; not sure what the cause of the issue is yet, but one of the backend servers in the EU DC is causing some ruckus. The NA one seems fine though; will have this fixed in a bit.</p></p>

Maybe, if possible from the technical side, you can add an image of the character? I don’t know how it’s mashed up in your systems, but showing the user’s avatar, like in the character selection screen, would be awesome.</p></p>

<p>Rest assured, this is something I really, really want too. There’s a lot of moving parts that need to be ironed out before it’s feasible though, so we’ll probably be sticking to low-hanging fruit for awhile yet  :&lt;</p></p>

<p>We might not actually have the EU DC issue fixed until next week — any requests that get routed there won’t work for now. My bad for shipping stuff on a Friday :&lt;</p>
<p>In the meanwhile, NA’s IP address is 64.25.40.16. Requests sent to that IP should work correctly while we figure out the issue.</p></p>

<p>I’ve been messing with this API just for fun and I was wondering if it’s be possible to add a field like last_played or is_online to individual characters?</p>
<p>I feel like the guild rep info would be more useful if we could see what character, if any, is being played at a given time. That said, it’s just an idea; I don’t actually need it for anything and I don’t know how easy it’d be to implement.</p>
<p>Anyway thanks for all the great work on the API stuff and for being so responsive to feedback/concerns.</p></p>

<p>
<p>Was messing around with the API as well, and gotta say it’s a lot of fun to see how the authorized API is progressing!</p>
<p>I am currently working on a new version of gw2wardrobe.com, and am using the new API v2 for it. I am so excited for the ability to see which skins your account has unlocked! I have mostly everything ready for when that goes live.</p>
<p>A question about /v2/character/:id/equipment: will we get access to what skins the character is wearing as well? Say, for the chest piece, we get the ID for equipment, rune, infusions and skin?</p>
<p>Getting an image/portrait of the character would be sick as well! For now I’ll just have to <a href="http://178.62.192.69:3000/user/nightzirch">stick with generic images.</a></p></p>

<p>Yeah, skins, upgrades, and infusions are going to be accessible on both the current equipment and in the inventory/bank. One of the Guthub PRs has details about a unified “item stack” structure that exposes this in a normalized form.</p>

<p>That’s data that can be exposed, but we should have a discussion about how to do it in a way that makes your users happy. I have a hunch that we may want to hide that data behind a separate permission, but I haven’t thought about it enough to have a well-formed opinion.</p></p>

<p>
<p>I don’t have any users per se, I’m just a self taught programmer messing with it for fun and don’t really have a particular project in mind right now. I’m sure there’s some people here that would benefit from that data more than I would. Though I do agree that it should be somehow separate as a permission since it could be considered sensitive information to some players.</p></p>

<p>talking about permissions, i think it might be really useful to have the equipment and inventory of characters behind separate permissions too.</p>
<p>for example i will definitely write a quick tool gathering all the builds of guild members directly from the api (at the moment everyone has to do that manually), but it might make some people uncomfortable that i will basically also be able to view their inventories for whatever reason.</p></p>

<p>
<p>Great to see progress with the new character API, very useful.</p>
<p>One concern I have since OAuth was removed is that it will be near impossible to instruct ordinary users which permissions they need to add to their API key. This will be especially challenging given the new permissions being added as the API evolves.</p>
<p>Have you given any thought on how to enhance the usability of the API key generation with permissions?</p>
<p>Perhaps it could default to all permissions checked since we can’t pass a parameter of the permissions we require (ideal).</p></p>

<p>This is something I really thought about a lot already. I did an automated VPN Management software once, where a requirement was to actually see online clients, so I riddled about how handling this in GW2 could be achieved. The conclusion i drew was that without actually reworking the Online-status-management within the game client it is <strong>really</strong> hard. Mostly because I can see people who want to announce their online-status ingame correctly, but not to announce it to the public (or api, in that matter). Alternatively using a seperate permission for that would definitely be a proper solution, which is completely necessary. <br>
However, the feature itself would be incredibly useful, when it comes to organizing teams, groups, guilds and generate statistics such as average online time per guildmember per day or just how much logged in at least once a day.</p></p>

<p>I think a separate permission is probably best. Putting it into the guild permission (as suggested earlier), I think is a bit unintuitive (and awkward as the guild permission is currently only useful for guild leaders).</p></p>

<p>Can you put the Look / Wardrobe and Colors to the characters permission and only the Stats to the inventories (and later to the skills)?<br>
An other Idea could be an easy and an advanced mode for the permissions. Or an easy mode with opt out for all subpoints. <br>
Some ppl are already a little bit unhappy with the Guilds in the basics and even more with the Guilds in the characters.</p></p>

<p>If you call /v2/characters you get an ordered list (by descending last logged in), however if you call /v2/characters?page=0&amp;page_size=50 the order of the characters is randomize with every call. Is there something you can do about this or is this intended?</p>

<p>No. They are not order by creation time. Its the same order I get when requesting a page, although it doesn’t seem to change as often when requesting it repeatedly.</p>

<p>
<p>Whoops, you are right, they are in descending last logged out order (same as the character select screen in-game).<br>
The /v2/characters?page=0&amp;page_size=50 result is just randomized everytime (between de results you get for that page). You can actually still get the same order from /v2/characters if you use a page_size of 1 and just handle each page as one character.</p></p>

<p>Do you plan a translation for Characters (lang=)? <br>
Of course, it’s no problem to translate Race, Gender and Profession by my self. So I do not need a translation by API, but if it’s planed I would wait<img src="/include/images/smilies/wink.png"></p></p>

<p>Nah, those values are intended to be the string representation of numerical constants, i.e., meant for machine rather than human consumption. IMO, you should localize them in the application.</p></p>

<p>
<p>Hi all,</p>
<p>I follow the API development for quite a while now and am as a guild leader pleased that now the characters API is available.</p>
<p>And since I also have an immediate proposal to extend:</p>
<p>We use our guild page a plugin to display the characters of our members. Unfortunately, each member has to enter all of his characters by hand and also maintain it.</p>
<p>We have in addition to those already in the API information such as name, race and profession even the crafts profession, the associated orders, the commander, the fractal level and the Dungeons concluded Story Modes.</p>
<p>Is it planned to be able to read this information about the API and the best to even a character image, so you only need an API key and all the information of the members to be able to automatically display on the guild page.</p>
<p>Best regards</p>
<p>Markus</p></p>

<p>I don’t think we’ll allow the guild leader’s API key to act as a skeleton key for their guild members. There’d have to be some kind of opt-in system for guild members, and at that point we might as well just stick to the key per-person approach.</p>

<p>I could, however, see an argument made for “show me what I can see in game”. As such, I’d be able to see the account.1234 of everyone in the guild, along with their AP total, and some stats on currently logged in character, such as name, locataion, and crafting skills.</p>
<p>I can pass on the crafting skills, but if the above were available via API, one could poll it every so often, and slowly build a list of characters that people play with, thus delivering roughly what Markus wanted.</p>
<p>I don’t see this as a guild leader skeleton key, just a base feature.</p></p>

<p>Hi,</p>

<p>I can’t really comment meaningfully on our release timeline. The data doesn’t come from a database, per se, but is handled by multiple backend servers that have to be kept in-sync with the normal game release processes. Regardless, I’ll try to get everything out as soon as I can.</p></p>

<p>
<p>IMHO, querying Chars by their name is a <strong>very</strong> bad idea. Not only is there a huge potential for messesd up queries (i know <strong>lots</strong> of players using strange unicode-stuff in their names – and we all know how “well” a lot of proxies/http-libs handle that stuff) and its making managing characters a major pita because people can always change their name using a name-change contract (which means: they are changing the “primary key” by which you can find their data in your database).</p>
<p>It would be nice if you could add a GUID for the characters as well and probably add the possibility to query by that GUID instead of the charname.</p></p>

<p>I threw an <a href="https://github.com/arenanet/api-cdi/issues/32">issue into github</a> for this; it was something I was meaning to do before release but it slipped my mind. Querying by id is going to be surprisingly difficult (since the id will have to be generated from some immutable private per-character data), but throwing it into the character blob as a unique identifying field should be pretty straightforward.</p></p>

<p>Not sure if this relates to the questions asked above but I’m having problems with the order of characters.</p>
<p>When requesting character info by Id’s (‘<a href="https://api.guildwars2.com/v2/characters?ids">https://api.guildwars2.com/v2/characters?ids</a>=’ + namesString), I get all characters but they come in different order everytime. For example, If I request [A,B,C]; The return data will be [A,C,B] or [C,B,A] etc…</p></p>

<p>
<p>I’d recommend just sorting them client-side if you want them ordered — there’s going to be &lt;=64 strings, so it’s not that big of a deal.</p>
<p>I hesitate to sort them on the server, since there might be some useful meaning in the ordering (e.g., determining which characters have been played most recently). I’d rather not take that datum away.</p></p>

<p>I was wondering: Does some of the character data really needs to be hidden behind a key? I mean everyone in game can basically already see if someone is online, the equipment and stuff. It would be nice if you could query a name to get his/her build too. Why was it chosen to make this API behind a key if you can view most information in game without their permission as well? Sorry if I missed something! I believe that making this more public really would open more oppurtunities for sites</p></p>

<p>
<p>No. Just no. Yes, you can see if someone is online (unless invisible). But you cannot see their equipment or build. You can – if you manage to find that character in the world – see the SKINS one is wearing, but not the actual items.</p>
<p>Unlike in a certain competing game you cannot right-click “inspect” characters. GW2 does not have its own armory. And this is something I like.</p>
<p>Please Anet, don’t make GearScore a thing in GW2! EVER!</p>
<p>If anything the API needs MORE fine grained permissions rather than less.</p></p>

<p>So quick question for the devs, I was messing with the API earlier after I had left a guild, and I noticed that my characters are still shown as representing that guild, even though it no longer shows up in <strong>/v2/account</strong>. Is this intentional or a bug?</p></p>

<p>I just don’t understand why you wouldn’t want people to not see your build? It is not that private right? I can imagine you don’t want your inventory or bank to be shown. But what is wrong with making builds public?</p>
<p>I think there are many possibilities if you would make the API public (in sense that you can query the (sPvP) builds of other people). If you would limit it only to your own character, I don’t think there would be many reasons to not just log in on GW2 itself and check their info. Maybe you can provide me with some cool idea’s that could be implemented right now with /v2/characters/ being private, and some reasons why your build should be private to other players to convince me?</p></p>

<p>The build itself (i.e. selection of traits), especially after the upcoming patch, would probably not be that problematic. But I foresee the meta zerker elite kittens in LFG tool will start with gear checks before running even the simplest dungeon. As long as they need to ask for an API key I can just laught at them and leave. If everyone can always check everyone else I am afraid mandatory gear checks will become commonplace.</p>
<p>I’ve played WoW and have seen how the community became after the rise of GearScore (and similar addons). I do not want to see this happening in GW2, too. Many LFG tool listings already look discouraging. I don’t want to see support for this behaviour by granting access to data.</p>
<p>This is pretty much along the same line why I don’t want to see damage meters in GW2. That is another topic, but many of the reasons against them apply here too.</p>
<p>As for what you can do when the API is private: almost everything you can do if it was public. As long as each player agrees and voluntarily gives you a key to access his or her data. You can still pull up a GW2 equivalent of the WoW armory, but only list players agreeing to the service. You just can’t spy on or stalk people, who don’t opt-in.</p>
<p>You seem to be thinking about SPvP builds, though. I see those a bit less strict, as they can already be inspected by spectators in game and I haven’t seen the PvP players as elitist about builds as the PvE’ers and PvP gear is a non-issue anyway.</p>
<p>Also remember that API access can be easily automated. You can track my online times manually via the friend list, but this is quite cumbersome. A service that tracks online times of every player would just be spooky.</p></p>

<p>I think you provide a few good reasons! I don’t play Dungeons myself, but I have heard a few people complain about players being aggressive on gear or professions you run. (Of course I don’t agree with this behaviour) Even though this can happen, I personally think it’s better that you get told upfront that they rather want another profession or other gear (you don’t want to stick which such a group anyway:P) then that they are raging about it during or after the dungeon path. Aside that, there would be no need to ask for the key, since the player could already easily link his/her armor them in the chat. (I think most players wouldn’t know about the keys)</p>
<p>But as you already noticed, I was aiming more for sPvP. It would be nice if you could check the builds enemies characters run while you’re waiting before the match, so you can discuss strategy a bit more. Or to see how successful people have been with certain builds for the past matches. I think cool things could be realized this way.</p>
<p>Maybe it is an option to split the sPvP build and the PvE build such that we don’t have the dungeon problems? But I guess this will be a bit of a hassle to maintain. So I still voting for builds to be publicly available without key. Of course I do believe that the online stat shouldn’t be shown to everyone.</p>
<p>Maybe it is a good idea to provide an authorized friendlist API where players can see who is online? I am not sure if it is possible to also chat with friend using the API? That would be really amazing, but it might be tough to implement.</p>
<p>Thanks for sharing your view!</p>
<p>EDIT: I just looked up the Damage Meter, and I really agree that would be a bad idea. I hope the community will take care of the armor checks though. Overall if most people think the same way about just enjoying the game with people then it should be alright I hope.</p></p>

<p>I noticed the same thing — it’s because the represented guild is stored in your character blob(s) and isn’t updated when you’re kicked from a guild. There’s technical reasons behind this inconsistency (<strong>waves arms and mumbles about distributed systems</strong>) but the fact that the endpoint does not reconcile against a more authoritative data source is a bug.</p>
