I’m really very new to Python and API queries and I just wanted to practice learning about these using GW2 API. I just wanted to ask two questions, if you don’t mind:</p>\n<p>1. Where could I learn more about Python-specific notes about accessing the GW2 API?</p>\n<p>2. In the match details API for WvW, what’s the match_id and how do I get it? I can access the JSON by mucking around with urllib2 (and by guessing a match_id) but I don’t really know what match it was referring to. (Note: I used 2-7 for the match_id). Can you guys help?</p>\n<p>Again, I’m very new so pardon the noobish questions. Thanks in advance!</p>","arenanet":false}]}
