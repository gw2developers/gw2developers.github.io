<p>How often is the event data updated? I don’t want to pull the event data faster than necessary, or put any extra stain on you guys.</p>
<p>Thanks for the endpoints!</p></p>

<p>
<p>The event data is updated in real-time, and there is no perceptible delay between an event state changing on the game server and it being updated in the API view.</p>
<p>Feel free to update as often as you’d like, though you probably don’t need to update more often than every 30 seconds or so.</p></p>

<p>Yes, please! Or even better: create a stickied (non discussion) FAQ thread where we could qoute or link important information.</p>
<p>Along with these qoutes from Cliff:</p>
<p>caching:</p>
<blockquote><div class="quotey"><p>Yes, please cache the results!</p>
<p>The names are guaranteed to be static between game patches/builds, but it’s possible for the list to grow between patches. The Events API, like the Item API, only shows events and maps that have been discovered by players.</p>
<p>So the ‘perfect’ logic would be to cache the results, and only do a lookup after a patch or if you don’t have a cached result for a particular event ID. And you probably don’t really need to do it between patches, as event names will rarely if ever change after being created.</p></div></blockquote>
<p>item discovery:</p>
<blockquote><div class="quotey"><p>If any player in the world participates in an event, then it is considered discovered. <br>
If any player in the world acquires an item, then it is considered discovered.</p>
<p>How quickly an item or event is discovered depends on how well-hidden it is in the world. It’s possible that an event or item might never be discovered.<img src="/include/images/smilies/smile.png"></p>
<p>Edit: To clarify, once something is discovered on any world, it is considered discovered on all worlds.</p></div></blockquote></p>

<p>Pretty much everything would get discovered pretty fast…. there are a lot o worlds, and a lot of PVE players.</p></p>

<p>
<p>Well, there are still like 1500+ items which haven’t been discovered again since the last flush of items.json – and a lot of these are not items which have been removed or are seasonal (e.g. recipe items for a lot of ascenced weapons are missing).<br>
To be exact: my local database lists 31216 items and 8233 recipes while items.json lists 29688 and recipes.json 8115.</p></p>

<p>
<p>well… you could always get someone.. or some people….  to find the differences and fix it manually. have a community .json</p>
<p>or due to the lack of people….. set up a script to find which items one list has and what items the other doesn’t.</p>
<p>“call the api for each item, compare the name text between them, move on if equal, store item code if false.”</p></p>

<p><a href="http://gw2.chillerlan.net/missing_items.html">http://gw2.chillerlan.net/missing_items.html</a></p>
<p>For me it’s as easy as:<br>
</p><pre><code>
$q = sql_query('SELECT * FROM `gw2_items`');
$count = count($q);
if(is_array($q) &amp;&amp; $count &gt; 0){	
	$data = gw2_api_request('items.json');
	if(is_array($data) &amp;&amp; isset($data['items'])){
		foreach($q as $item){
			if(!in_array($item['id'], $data['items'])){
				//yada yada yada
			}
		}
	}	
}
</code></pre><p></p>
<p>Sure, it could be quite more effective, but it serves the point.</p></p>

<p>
<p>Yep it’s the result. And yes, PHP is a C derivate<img src="/include/images/smilies/wink.png"></p>
<p>(so you might want to check out PHP and maybe JavaScript (also C derivate, not Java) examples for ideas, too)</p></p>

<p>Im a visual basic programmer… so i gathered it was one of the major relatives…</p>
<p>Well, as long as we have a list of items, that is accessible to the devs, it is now something that they have a direct knowledge to be able to fix, although it probably deserves its own thread.</p></p>

<p>
<p>I just mentioned it because you were asking for C++ and VB examples – and since they’re all kind of C derivates it’s sometimes helpful to look beyond the Tellerrand to gather ideas<img src="/include/images/smilies/wink.png"></p>
<p>Oh, a moderator may be so kind and split this topic if possible. Thanks.</p></p>
