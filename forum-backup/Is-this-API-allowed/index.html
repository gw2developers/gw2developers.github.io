<p>AFAIK it is a separate program that does not modify Guild Wars in any way. It doesn’t modify game files, processes, nothing.</p>
<p>Imagine you have a web browser open and you open a calculator and place it over the window. That is what an overlay does. It is an independent program that just positions itself over some other application window.</p>
<p>Wait for a second opinion on this, but I’m pretty sure I got it right.</p></p>

<p>
<p>The overlay is basically a very tiny, non-obtrusive Web browser with no more (and far less) functionality than a normal Web browser. It’s harmless.</p></p>

<p>You heard wrong. People aren’t banned easily in this game and an overlay isn’t exploiting unless it’s a bot.</p></p>

<p>The authors of these “overlay” programs would allow themselves a lot less controversy if they didn’t call it an overlay. Just call it a program that uses always-on-top to position itself above the GW2 window.</p>
<p>The term overlay is traditionally reserved for DirectDraw overlays (surfaces). For example, the FPS counter in Fraps, or XFire, or many VOIP applications.</p>

<p>What I am curious about is what’s ANet’s stand on actually injecting the GW2 process with stuff like DirectDraw overlays (i.e. actually incorporating an overlay on top of GW2 like Steam etc. does).</p>
<p>Would that be considered as breach of rules? I mean as far as I remember EULA applies to altering resources (files) on disk but what is the actual standpoint on changing those in memory (process)?</p></p>

<p>
<p>As ANet have now made the API public, I can not see any reason why this would get you banned. If they banned you for this then they would have to ban you from moving any other application over the top of your game window.</p></p>

<p>I understood the OP’s doubt.<br>
The software has to “recognize” GW2.<br>
IF GW2 has not the “focus”, the GW2Stuff overlay is not “thruclicable”.</p>
<p>The doubt is an “hack&amp;exploit detect engine” from ANet could take it as an hack or something else.</p></p>

<p>There is no single answer for that. They are obviously fine with voip programs doing it but it would be impossible to say that every other possible use is also fine.</p></p>

<p>It doesn’t need to interact with GW2 at all to make it recognize the GW2 window, as it can just ask windows that, same with ‘thruclicability’ being just something that windows handles. That is, assuming it’s programmed in a sane manner. Any hack &amp; exploit engine from Anet would only recognize this program if it specifically goes through your list of processes and looking for it, or just hating on all AutoIt programs.</p>
<p>I believe there was a huge stink over Blizzard’s detection engine scanning through your other applications and it no longer does this as it was looking through all kinds of things it shouldn’t and now keeps itself to scanning through it’s own memory. I would assume that any engine Anet would come up with would be limited in a similar manner.</p></p>

<p>
<p>is it allowed?</p>
<p>i would say yes.</p>
<p>they said in the documentation pinned topic<br>
“We’re really excited to share these APIs with you. There are already some amazing community apps and websites out there, and we hope that these APIs enhance them and enable new ones to be created.”</p>
<p>they wouldn’t release these api things if they didn’t want people using them.</p>
<p>this overlay thing is like having the game in windowed mode on half the screen and a timer site on the other side and that’s ok with them (since they released an event status api). this is just having that timer floating on top of the game window rather than by the side or alt-tabbing out to view it.</p></p>

<p>
<p>We have a 3rd party app policy located here: <a href="https://forum-en.guildwars2.com/forum/support/account/Policy-3rd-Party-Programs-Multi-Boxing-Macros/first">https://forum-en.guildwars2.com/forum/support/account/Policy-3rd-Party-Programs-Multi-Boxing-Macros/first</a>.</p>
<p>This policy was written before we had APIs available, and needs to be updated to make it clear that we encourage app development and usage. We realize that in its current form it can be hard to figure out what is acceptable.</p>
<p>Our hope is that the new policy will make it very clear what is acceptable, so that you don’t have to worry about getting banned by using an app. The new policy is still being written, and we will update you when it’s ready.</p>
<p>It’s our intent to allow API-derived apps like GW2Stuff’s overlay to be used by players. From our perspective, having an overlay is just a different way of presenting content. We are not currently banning players simply for using overlays, and have no plans to do so.</p></p>

<p>It is <em>not</em> like the Steam overlay. The Steam overlay (as well as Origin’s, and others’) is injected into the program at run-time. For third party tools this is actually what you could get in trouble for but if there were a risk of that you’d already know it.</p>

<p>It doesn’t. It doesn’t know anything about you. It only knows the state of (certain) events and it displays that regardless of what you’d like.</p></p>

<p>Can we hope, as we ask for it since many years, since TexMod, an “Validated App List” or something like that ?<br>
Event if you check one app per week. Just for peace of mind…</p>

<p>Almost certainly not. The very moment ArenaNet whitelists a third party tool ArenaNet assumes responsibility for anything that tool does. They’ll never want to do that (and they’d be fools to). Somebody could have a tool whitelisted and only <em>then</em> make it dangerous.</p></p>
