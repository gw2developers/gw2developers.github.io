We have a bot that sends a text message when an unregistered user logs in with a link to a website.  When they click the link it checks a couple things like their username is formatted correctly and gives a landing page with a brief description.</p>\n<p>They click a button there to authenticate, and if they’re on TC the mumble bot is sent a signal and register the person.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, at the moment the bot host is having some connectivity issues with the mumble server.   Typical … the bots been running for months (it does other stuff as well) with no problems.</p>","arenanet":false},{"pubDate":"2015-03-26T20:01:39.000Z","guid":"http://forum-en.guildwars2.com/forum/community/api/New-WvW-Maps/4921784","author":"Cosmic.6047","body":"\n<p>All the objectives should have a time stamp when the last ownership change occurred.</p>","arenanet":false},{"pubDate":"2015-03-26T18:12:38.000Z","guid":"http://forum-en.guildwars2.com/forum/community/api/New-WvW-Maps/4921429","author":"Lawton Campbell.8517","body":"\n<blockquote><div class=\"citey\"><cite title=\"Posted on March 26 2015 03:55AM\"><a href=\"/forum/community/api/New-WvW-Maps/4919714\">Nabrok.9023:</a></cite></div><div class=\"quotey\"><p>While we’re talking about timers … how about the time of the next score tick?</p></div></blockquote>\n<p>Yeah, that’d be really useful too.</p>\n<p>I really need to sit down and draft an initial proposal for the /v2/wvw endpoints.</p>\n<blockquote><div class=\"citey\"><cite title=\"Posted on March 26 2015 03:55AM\"><a href=\"/forum/community/api/New-WvW-Maps/4919714\">Nabrok.9023:</a></cite></div><div class=\"quotey\"><p>That would be great, but I agree that the authenticated endpoints are more important.
