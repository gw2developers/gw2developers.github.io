A lot of them are pretty easy to figure out since they’re usually tied to dialog options, but there’s a both a handful of debug-only dialogs that you’ll never see as a player, and a handful of vendors that aren’t accessible via dialogs (e.g., the ecto gambling one that you open with an item).</p>\n<p>Anyway, the implementation on both our sides would be the same — a hardcoded list.
