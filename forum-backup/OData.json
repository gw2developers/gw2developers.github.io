The link addresses issues from some developer on how OData can be improved upon for generic purposes.  Do we need to “create media types to describe these key pieces of data” as mentioned in the link for ArenaNet’s API?  Not really.  Do we currently “construct URIs based on information that is not available or linked to in the response” for the current ArenaNet’s API?  Of course we do.</p>\n<p>Therefore, if supporting “these features” are really that important to you, rather than going ahead with the current implementation, which is also lacking, you should be proposing another open REST protocol standard that support “these features”, if you can. <img src=\"/include/images/smilies/smile.png\"></p>\n<blockquote><div class=\"quotey\"><p>OData is brining <em>nothing</em> useful to the table.</p></div></blockquote>\n<p>Since I hate repeating myself: <a href=\"https://forum-en.guildwars2.com/forum/community/api/OData/first#post3704642\">https://forum-en.guildwars2.com/forum/community/api/OData/first#post3704642</a></p>\n<blockquote><div class=\"quotey\"><p>I haven’t addressed your insistence on “it also supports JSON” because there really isn’t any point.
