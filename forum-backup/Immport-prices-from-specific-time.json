I would manually have to go through the graf and record all the prices. The idea was to gather a ton of items and see how the prices fluctuate over time in order to meassure the inflation in the game. Then compare it with pre and post launch of HoT to see what changes in terms of money gain and the prices of different items.</p>\n<p>EDIT: Thanks for the help though, it’s much appresiated!</p>","arenanet":false},{"pubDate":"2015-09-18T13:22:47.000Z","guid":"http://forum-en.guildwars2.com/forum/community/api/Immport-prices-from-specific-time/5504488","author":"Eearslya.6309","body":"\n<p>Spidy has their graphs because they constantly check and record the prices every 15 minutes or so.

But what I need some help with is import the prices, but from certain times.</p>\n<p>Is it possible to import the price of X item from e.g. January 1st at 00.00? And how would I get around to make that into a script, if it’s even possible?</p>\n<p>i know that Spidy do have the prices, since they have their graphs, but doing it manually would simply be to time consuming<img src=\"/include/images/smilies/smile.png\"></p>","arenanet":false}]}
