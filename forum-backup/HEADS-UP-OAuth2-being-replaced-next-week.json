This is especially true when there is no way of helping them trought the process. In case of incorrect API permissions some people would probably be fast to claim that apps simply aren’t working and just forget about them (even when the apps would clearly tell the user that his permissions are just wrong, I’ve seen that already and enough of it) which would hurt us developers too.</p>\n<p>Since the generation-link proposal was already dismissed how about atleast the feature to let people enter a character representation of the needed flags. For example, when we have sufficient flags just bring them into a binary string and convert this into base64 or even just a normal A-Za-z0-9 interpretation. This way the apps could tell the user to enter “Adz9s2” into a box that will tick the correct boxes (ofcourse this would need some kind of checksum to ensure that typos won’t alter the flags). We could then have an non authenticated API that we feed what flags we need and get the string-representation back to ensure that everyone has the correct strings and we don’t need to depend this on third-party-libraries or selfcoding.</p>\n<p>This way we could atleast guide users trought the process, telling them what to enter where. Also, yes I realize that this will still need the users to verify what permissions they will give, but really there’s not much difference to just telling them what to tick, because those who know about risks will check permissions anyway and those who don’t wouldn’t probably understand the impact of the permissions they are giving and just click whatever we tell them.</p>","arenanet":false},{"pubDate":"2015-05-08T04:12:34.000Z","guid":"http://forum-en.guildwars2.com/forum/community/api/HEADS-UP-OAuth2-being-replaced-next-week/5044690","author":"Slyfer.6478","body":"\n<p>I like the idea that different keys have different permissions, gives the tech-savvy option to protect certain info and deal with a possible uproar about elitism.

I want a way for users to quickly register their info without having to jump all the hoops, currently it’s just easier for guilds to follow the regular shivtr.com path, because it’s less steps (register, then login on any other guild site you want to apply into).  What i propose is enable a ‘Generate API key’ link. The link would redirect to guildwars2.com, then pop up a window with all the permissions the link requests (e.g account, materials, bank) and asks you to accept or refuse, upon success, just redirect to a page that is not cluttered and centers the API key in the web browser in a large font with instructions as to minimalize any PEBCAK. Example of the link would be something like:<br>\n<a href=\"https://account.guildwars2.com/account/generate-api-key?perm=account+bank+materials\">https://account.guildwars2.com/account/generate-api-key?perm=account+bank+materials</a><br>\nAs far as phishing concerns go, i think nothing changes, if this does not take effect, i’m still going to redirect people to account.guildwars2.com but i wont be able to hold their hand once they get there.</p>","arenanet":false},{"pubDate":"2015-05-08T00:00:22.000Z","guid":"http://forum-en.guildwars2.com/forum/community/api/HEADS-UP-OAuth2-being-replaced-next-week/5044016","author":"Pilot.6094","body":"\n<p>I have a few comments/suggestions about the new API key system. My primary concern is user drop-off, I’m sure it is in everyone’s best interest to get users through the API generation process as easily as possible…</p>\n<p>1) “API Keys” in the left menu – on the plus side most users will probably be able to locate this menu option. It would be better if it was a red button.</p>\n<p>2) Name and description for the API key – IMO will confuse most users, they will think there are specific things they need to enter here and most likely will drop off. If they read the text they might figure it out, but as we know most people won’t bother to read more than a few words. Additionally most people won’t understand why they are creating an API key in the first place.</p>\n<p>3) The permissions check box. While not a problem now since there is only one permission (“account”). I can see this as a show stopper after new permissions are added. App developers need a way to request a minimal set of permissions (perhaps by passing ids on the querystring).</p>\n<p>4) After the key is generated there needs to be a button to copy it to the clipboard. The key is long and the font is small, so there is a high probability that it will be copied incorrectly.</p>\n<p>I understand management made the decision to remove OAuth, but this doesn’t add any extra protection against phishing.

And they would probably not fall for phishing in the first place.)</p>\n<hr>\n<p>TL;DR of the remaining post: Users are lazy, UX is horrible, doesn’t fix the phishing problem, OAuth was better for everyone.</p>\n<p>OAuth was easy to implement (with thousands of tested libraries available for all languages/frameworks) and had great UX for users. API keys are horrible UX-wise. There are just so many scenarios that just don’t work well with API keys.</p>\n<p>1.) Most Users will just generate 1 key with full permissions and reuse it for all apps. Once they want to revoke access to their account from one app (and the app doesn’t provide an easy way of doing that in the app/the user doesn’t trust the app to completely remove the key), the users has to generate a new key and reenter it in all other apps he uses. (There could be quite a few “passive” apps he doesn’t often visit and only notices the errors months after).</p>\n<p>2.) An app requires the permissions X, Y and Z, but the users forgets that by the time he has logged in to the account page (can take quite some time: 2 factor, email for unknown IP, looking up password in password manager/phone/notebook, …) and only allows access to X and Y. Now the users has to do all that again after entering the API key in the app and getting an error. Maybe he was using private browsing and has to do the login to his account page all over again.</p>\n<p>3.) An app requires new permissions after an update, the user now has to create a new key and enter it again, maybe even for multiple apps that required the same permissions before and he was sharing the key for.</p>\n<p>4.) You create a new scope for the API, the user now also has to update all apps in case he only uses one key for all apps. And no matter how much we tell the users to generate new keys with specific permissions for each app, most users won’t do that because they are lazy and don’t see the problems of it in the future.</p>\n<p>5.) Probably way more than that, those were just a few off the top of my head, but we will run into more problems once we are using them…</p>\n<p>OAuth had easy solutions for most of these problems by simply doing most of it behind the scenes, leaving the user no way to mess up. Just clicking one button and the app had all required permissions with an easy way of updating/revoking permissions per app.</p>\n<p>I know OAuth has some flaws, but API-Keys for users that don’t understand them are way worse IMHO.</p>","arenanet":false},{"pubDate":"2015-05-03T18:37:58.000Z","guid":"http://forum-en.guildwars2.com/forum/community/api/HEADS-UP-OAuth2-being-replaced-next-week/5029939","author":"Lawton Campbell.8517","body":"\n<blockquote><div class=\"citey\"><cite title=\"Posted on May 03 2015 09:34AM\"><a href=\"/forum/community/api/HEADS-UP-OAuth2-being-replaced-next-week/5029040\">Firedancer.8350:</a></cite></div><div class=\"quotey\"><p>I would love him to re-explain what he means, just for us “common folk” who also play the game and completely do not get what he has just tried to tell me…</p></div></blockquote>\n<p>To echo Tanis, this change has absolutely nothing to do with the game.

Existing OAuth2 clients will continue to work, but the management interface will not be accessible.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Thursday, June 4th</strong>: All OAuth2 clients will be disabled. Only API keys will be usable for authenticated requests.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>API keys effectively in the same manner as OAuth2 access tokens: to use them, you pass them via the ‘Authorization’ header, e.g.</p>\n<pre><code>    GET /v2/account HTTP/1.1\n    Host: api.guildwars2.com\n    Authorization: Bearer EA9F0026-FEEF-9046-840B-30E8EC68B4FE5A0585DA-333B-454A-9C1F-6A548AB2D690\n\n</code></pre>\n<p>API keys do not expire until the user explicitly deletes them via the management interface.
