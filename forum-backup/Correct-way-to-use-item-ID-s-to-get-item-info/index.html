<p>
<p>For the past two weeks i have been trying to work out the best way to get data from the item and commerce api’s by using PHP and jQuery. I would be happy to use other methods however i am not familiar with them.</p>
<p>Currently i am experimenting with jQuery. My method is as follows:</p>
<ol>
	<li>getJSON on the ‘v2/commerce/prices’ to get a listing of all the ID’s which are in the shop.</li>
	<li>Create a loop for all the ID’s in step one</li>
	<li>Inside the loop getJSON for ‘/v2/items?id=Step_1_ID’ which allows me to access the ‘name’, ‘icon’ and other info.</li>
	<li>Inside the loop getJSON for ‘v2/commerce/prices?id=Step_1_ID’ which allows me to get the ‘buy’ and ‘sell’ info.</li>
</ol>
<p>I feel like i am approaching this wrong and am creating way too many requests which could be simplified greatly.</p>
<p>I have also tried this method with PHP however it was extremely slow. I tried optimising it with curl however when running around 100-200 items it would take about 3 seconds per item.</p>
<p>The goal of doing this would be to create my own local json file which could then be updated and used to populate a mysql database.</p></p>

<p>
<p>You may want to create a database for the item data and only request them once a week or day.</p>
<p>For requesting massive data you should use pagination. This will reduce the amount of requests to v2/commerce/prices from 22480 to 113 when using a page_size of 200 (maximum value.)</p>

<p>I don’t think this is what i am looking for. Unless there is a way to use the pagination to speed up multiple requests with individual ID’s. Optimally i am looking for a solution which creates something like “?ids=all” for items, as my current solution for looping requests with the individual ID’s is a slow process.</p>
<p>I understand using pagination would be a good way to do it if it was outputting the content onto a page directly with each call. This would then use pagination to show the first 100 items with buttons to load the other items.</p>
<p>I am trying to find the best way to get all of the content into a json file which can then populate a database. For the items and their information i would update them on a daily basis if they content had changed but for the prices and other more dynamic data i would like to update that more frequently.</p></p>

<p>The way I populate my database is by first checking the /v2/items endpoint and getting every ID. Then I loop through them, creating a request URL that consists of around 190 IDs (because for some reason 200 didn’t always work for me), then storing that URL in an array, and moving on to the next URL with the next 190 items. Then you simply loop through those URLs instead, bringing 40k+ requests down to around 200.</p></p>

<p>Eearslya.6309 I think this is the correct solution thankyou. I can’t work out any other way to speed up the process.</p></p>

<p>I’m a bit confused. Why not looping through all pages? The api returns header information containing the page count.</p></p>

<p>
<p>I am not sure what header information containing the page count you are talking about. Looping through individual pages was causing 20000 requests i have dropped it down to around 170. From your previous comment i have stopped requests like this:</p>
<ul>
	<li><a href="https://api.guildwars2.com/v2/items?id=1">https://api.guildwars2.com/v2/items?id=1</a></li>
	<li><a href="https://api.guildwars2.com/v2/items?id=2">https://api.guildwars2.com/v2/items?id=2</a></li>
	<li><a href="https://api.guildwars2.com/v2/items?id=3">https://api.guildwars2.com/v2/items?id=3</a></li>
</ul>
<p>And made my request bundle the id’s up to chunks of 200.</p>
<ul>
	<li><a href="https://api.guildwars2.com/v2/items?ids=1,2,3">https://api.guildwars2.com/v2/items?ids=1,2,3</a></li>

<p>I..was actually unaware you could simply request by page number. This would actually be a lot simpler, I might implement this instead. Thanks!</p></p>

<p>
<p>So you are suggesting instead of doing a long line of ID’s (?ids=1,2,3) the best way to get the data is:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Get the X-Page-Total from the HTTP header on a URL like this:<br>
- <a href="https://api.guildwars2.com/v2/commerce/listings.json?page=0?page_size=200">https://api.guildwars2.com/v2/commerce/listings.json?page=0?page_size=200</a></li>
	<li>Loop through the “page?=LoopNumber” until i hit the X-Page-Total</li>
</ol>
<p>I tried doing this quickly and when using the above URL despite my “?page-size=200” i get a page_size of 50 and a x-page-total of 450 in the HTTP header.  When using the ID’s i could loop 200 of them and get around 113 requests. Do i ignore the page-size and x-page-total and use the X-Result-Total/(maximum page-size).</p></p>

<p>The parameter is page_size (with an underscore, not a dash). Also, if you want to pass more than one parameter, you seperate them with an ampersand (&amp;).<br>
So, the request would be <strong>/v2/items?page=0&amp;page_size=200</strong></p></p>
