I did use the delegate workaround, but ONLY for api.guildwars2.com.  Granted, there is still some small chance of a man-in-the-middle attack, since there’s no user-auth or user info exposed I don’t see it as particularly likely to be harmful (if even attempted).</p>\n<p>I’m still at a loss at why my machine (and device) aren’t seeing the same thing yours is though.  I’ll double check GW2Kit and see what you did.
