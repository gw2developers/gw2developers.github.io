But one way or another, It has been 3 weeks now since that map has been added. Isnt there an api specific dev team, or are they all working on the living story at the moment? rhetoric question to some degree i suppose since you prolly wont know either.</p>","arenanet":false},{"pubDate":"2014-08-01T15:24:42.000Z","guid":"http://forum-en.guildwars2.com/forum/community/api/Episode-2-Dry-Top-Not-in-Tile-Service/4256677","author":"Dr Ishmael.9685","body":"\n<blockquote><div class=\"citey\"><cite title=\"Posted on July 31 2014 07:39AM\"><a href=\"/forum/community/api/Episode-2-Dry-Top-Not-in-Tile-Service/4252977\">AysonCurrax.3254:</a></cite></div><div class=\"quotey\"><blockquote><div class=\"citey\"><cite title=\"Posted on July 30 2014 03:09PM\"><a href=\"/forum/community/api/Episode-2-Dry-Top-Not-in-Tile-Service/4250861\">Dr Ishmael.9685:</a></cite></div><div class=\"quotey\"><blockquote><div class=\"citey\"><cite title=\"Posted on July 29 2014 12:29PM\"><a href=\"/forum/community/api/Episode-2-Dry-Top-Not-in-Tile-Service/4246484\">AysonCurrax.3254:</a></cite></div><div class=\"quotey\"><p>well, they would just have to take the ingame map as it is now and cut that up into 2^n by 2^n pieces.</p></div></blockquote>\n<p>That’s already how the map is stored in Gw2.dat.
