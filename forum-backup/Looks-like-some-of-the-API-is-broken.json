Even still, these questions should be sent directly to ANet’s community managers, and not blindly posted on forum threads.</p>\n<p>It’s a bit…ummm…not their problem? More explicitly, they (or any company in a similar position) aren’t beholden to your particular business needs because they’ve provided public APIs.</p>\n<p>Again, these thoughts are my own. I would expect that if dev energy <em>is</em> spent on this forum, it would be focused on only those discussions which are universally relevant to all API developers.</p>","arenanet":false},{"pubDate":"2014-05-07T19:30:24.000Z","guid":"http://forum-en.guildwars2.com/forum/community/api/Looks-like-some-of-the-API-is-broken/4000170","author":"Eowin Of Rohan.2619","body":"\n<blockquote><div class=\"citey\"><cite title=\"Posted on May 07 2014 05:48PM\"><a href=\"/forum/community/api/Looks-like-some-of-the-API-is-broken/3999815\">Stefan Larimore.6872:</a></cite></div><div class=\"quotey\"><p>Hi All, thank you for the report.
