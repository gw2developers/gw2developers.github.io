<p>
<p>Using the trading post web UI has now been disabled so I need to transition to using /v2/, but there seems to be a glaring omission- how does one actually search for itemids?</p>
<p>If I want a list of all Tempest weapons I would previously simply do a search for ‘Tempest’, and then queried the returned list for price information, but /v2/ doesn’t seem to have this at all.</p></p>

<p>We don’t currently provide a search endpoint, sorry. It’s something we’re looking at but has implications for the backing services that we need to work through.</p></p>

<p>Okay, thanks.</p>
<p>Would have been nice if the functionality that worked wasn’t specifically disabled before the API caught up, but I’m assuming that’s outside your purview.</p></p>

<p>Of course.</p>
<p>It’s just a tad frustrating that someone had to go out of their way and spend time disabling something that wasn’t in any way substitutable by the API.</p>
<p>It’s completely understandable that API isn’t the a main priority for development resources, I just expected the removal of the web endpoints to be the result of lack of maintenance causing them to break and be left broken- rather than a specific action to disable them.</p>
<p>Anyway, almost certainly wasn’t your call, just venting. Ignore me.</p></p>

<p>We didn’t go out of our way to remove them, we literally threw out all of that code and started from scratch. The entire Trading Post frontend was rewritten w/ no code brought forward from the old TP because it frankly wasn’t all that good. I say that as the person that wrote most of that code, so I’m not throwing anyone under the bus in case anyone was wondering.</p>
<p>And for the record I’m absolutely the person responsible for that decision. Vent away if you have to.</p></p>

<p>Have a look at gw2spidy.com, they have an api that allows you to search items by name. <br>
Kinda frustrating having to use another api for that, but meh.</p></p>

<p>
<p>If I may suggest something: You can also get all the ID’s and the corresponding names, then save them in a file. That way, instead of querying the server, you query your own file (which is <strong>way</strong> faster than making a request for further processing). You may have to write some extra code here and there, but you get a huge increase in efficiency and the ability to do it offline, as you don’t depend on the server anymore.</p>
<p>Whenever the game gets an update, you just redo &amp; compare (or just redo the whole process if you don’t want to bother comparing).</p>
<p>Hope it helps, happy programming.</p></p>

<p>You threw out all the code during the transition between the oldTP and newTP, obviously as the entire thing was moved over to CoherantUI.</p>
<p>However, after the transition the web endpoints were re-implemented under the new system, using new queries.</p>
<p>It was only after the most recent patch that the new web endpoints were disabled, they were disabled rather than broken. They return the single string ‘disabled’ and the commands that used to work are the only ones that do so.</p>
<p>Am I mistaken about this? Is the “rewriting the backend code” that you’re referring to something that occurred on both the initial transition (that left the new web endpoints accessible), and then again on the most recent patch (which left the new endpoints unavailable)?</p></p>
