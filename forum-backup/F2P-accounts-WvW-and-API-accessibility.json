But it can be solved pretty easily.<br>\nOne is to disallow the access to the API of F2P players (which is not really ideal). Two is to add an entry to /v2/account that shows if the account is a F2P or B2P account. This way we can check if it’s a bought account.</p>\n<p>I think the the latter one is the better option. It would still allow the F2P accounts get access to the API, while still having our TS WvW channels be clear of “possible spies”.</p>","arenanet":false}]}
