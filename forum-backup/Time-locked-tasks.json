Has it been suggested before to expose daily time locked tasks for a given account? By this I mean dungeons’ bonus bouncy chest, world boss bonus rare bouncy chest, timegated crafting as examples. Reason being is that players in some timezones, east coast for instance, would be playing in the time 2 hrs before and 2 hrs after daily reset. Its easy to see ingame whether you have crafted a certain recipe by simply going to the crafting station, but theres no way to tell if you have completed a certain dungeon during that gw2 day before or after reset the previous calendar day.</p>","arenanet":false}]}
