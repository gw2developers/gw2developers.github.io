The total number of pages is returned in the X-Page-Total response header (or you can continue until you get a “no more pages” error). I’d recommend doing this nightly since items don’t appear in the list until they’re discovered by players, which happens fairly regularly.</p>","arenanet":true},{"pubDate":"2015-10-28T23:09:24.000Z","guid":"http://forum-en.guildwars2.com/forum/community/api/Get-item-from-API-using-item-name/5680229","author":"smiley.1438","body":"\n<p>Simply put: you will need your own database to do a reverse search.</p>","arenanet":false},{"pubDate":"2015-10-28T21:13:50.000Z","guid":"http://forum-en.guildwars2.com/forum/community/api/Get-item-from-API-using-item-name/5679683","author":"UnknownFreak.2805","body":"\n<p>Hio!</p>\n<p>I’m currently working on a overlay project, and was wondering if you can easily get the item from v2/items by using a item name, how should I do this?</p>\n<p>Was thinking of making a map of &lt;itemName,itemID&gt;, but that will require me to go trough every item id in the item list, and that is a bit tedious, I can do it, and then save every &lt;itemName, itemID&gt; locally, so I can access it faster next time.</p>\n<p>Or will it be possible to add a search to v2/items by name?</p>","arenanet":false}]}
