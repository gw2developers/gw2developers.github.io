<p>I was curious on the restrictions “legaly” on using the API on the context they are used.</p>
<p>ok, that sounds pretty direct, ok, im just curious if i am allowed to use the API’s(currently just trading post) within “visual basic”.</p>
<p>Also, if anyone is interested(so long as we are allowed)<br>
I would love some help with this.</p>
<p>Also… is there a limit on the “API test”timing….. umm..rephrase… <br>
what’s the limit on the time between calls on an API?</p></p>

<p>All of this has been answered before and you could even find it without the broken search function<img src="/include/images/smilies/wink.png"></p>
<p>The trading post API isn’t official. So any software using it would possibly violate the terms of use (basically reverse engineering). However, there was no official statement on that topic yet.</p>

<p>Just to clarify, with the TP I’m only looking for the base info (current price (buy, order) and both listed amounts) as all I’m looking to make is a program for people looking to check up on their niche markets, while having the power to have information stored locally so they can see what times of the day specific items are moving and at what average flow rate.<br>

<p>Orthas,</p>
<p>I wouldn’t take it personally. smiley has been one of the most gracious voices on this sub forum, and sometimes answering the same thing all the time bums one out.</p>
<p>Building the type of experience you’re describing is a lot of work, no matter what the language you program it in. First, see if the answers provided in similar forum posts help you get the ball rolling. If your research only leads to more questions, I’d encourage you to post follow-up questions, resurrecting the very thread you found unclear.</p></p>

<p>The easiest way to get at the information that you are looking for, is to use the gw2spidy api here:</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/rubensayshi/gw2spidy/wiki/API-v0.9">https://github.com/rubensayshi/gw2spidy/wiki/API-v0.9</a></p>
<p>If you want to, you can also use the unofficial trading post API documented here:</p>
<p><a href="/forum-backup/Guide-to-the-Black-Lion-Trading-Co-API">https://forum-en.guildwars2.com/forum/community/api/Guide-to-the-Black-Lion-Trading-Co-API/first#post3307210</a></p>
<p>I would recommend you to use the gw2spidy api because then you can be 100% sure that you are not violating any terms of service, even though ArenaNet does not seem to mind us using that api to build legit programs so far.  But more importantly, the unofficial TP api may change at any time without warning, since it is unofficial.  Therefore it is safer to use the gw2spidy api.</p></p>

<p>
<p>FYI: GW2Spidy uses the trading post API aswell so it’s the same “grey zone” as if you would access directly.</p>
<p>€: Anet didn’t make any official statements about software which access the game direct or indirect. I think the only exception was Texmod which was said to be ok to use because it just changes textures on the clients PC.</p></p>

<p>But since you are using gw2spidy instead of accessing the TP api yourself, you are not in any risk of violating any terms, yourself.</p>
<p>It is a layer that shields you from any api changes, or any risk of violating ANet’s ToS which can get your GW2 access banned.</p>
<p>Furthermore, gw2spidy api is easier to program against.  There are lots of examples, you only need http-gets and you don’t need to provide any login credentials.  It is a totally public api.</p></p>

<p>This doesn’t make it any better – see my edit above. Plus: compared to texmod, the TP API and therefore any software whic uses it accesses the game directly and has possibly an impact on the market.<br>
Players in GW1 have been banned for less in the past.</p></p>

<p>According to the owner of gw2spidy, he has permission from ArenaNet to do what he does.  His website has been up for more than a year now and if ArenaNet had wanted to stop him, they would have easily done it by now.</p>
<p>But if you still have the fear of being banned, then even more so that you should use gw2spidy api instead of the unofficial TP api.  Gw2spidy api doesn’t require you to login, so your queries are unknown to ArenaNet since you are only hitting gw2spidy resources and database.  The unofficial TP api however, requires a login.</p></p>
