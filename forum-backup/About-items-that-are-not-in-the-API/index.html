<p>Could we get an update on this please? <br>
I run into a lot of issues while doing stuff with the API because of this, it would be nice to at least add the items that are bought from merchants.</p>
<p>If nothing can be done about this (maybe because of HoT leaks), maybe you guys could set up a list of items to be added manually that we could edit, and then take a look at the list from time to time, if it’s not too time-consuming?</p>
<p>(There is also other stuff that would probably need to be added manually anyway. For example, the Mini Lavish Llama: we know it’s in the game, we know its skin, we know its recipe, but since no one has gotten it yet, it doesn’t show up in the v2/items endpoint.)</p></p>

<p>There’s a bunch of merchants in-game that are not player-accessible (and sell things that people shouldn’t know about), so I’m hesitant to whitelist all items that are sold at a merchant.</p>
<p>I have a patch that tries to whitelist any item <strong>purchased</strong> from a merchant — that should fix most of the issues, though it won’t be ready for awhile longer.</p></p>

<p>I’m looking for the items that are part of legendary crafting and it looks like they’re not in the API.   For example, Gift of Exploration (19677) isn’t in any recipes.  Are mystic forge recipes excluded?  Should I post a bug in github?</p></p>

<p>The items are in the API just fine, but no, mystic forge recipes are not currently in the API. There have been a few requests for this already, but no official pull request on the GitHub.</p></p>

<p>I seem to remember that Mystic Forge recipes were always excluded due to the fact that they want us to guess the recipes.</p></p>

<p>So if they’re not player-accessible, why are they still ingame/in that list? (are they future items?)</p></p>

<p>You are right.  Found <a href="http://gw2wbot.darthmaim.de/smiley/gw2itemsearch.html">this site</a> to be very helpful in finding the item IDs manually.  Look like (so far) they are all in the API.</p></p>

<p>Thanks for mentioning my little search, glad that it helps in a way<img src="/include/images/smilies/colondee.png"><br>
Note that the backend database (same as <a href="http://gw2treasures.com">http://gw2treasures.com</a>) has been created long before the “item discovery reset” and was updated incremental, so there might be items listed which aren’t in the API anymore.</p></p>

<p>
<p>Wait, items were removed from the API?</p>
<p>AFAIK that shouldn’t have happened. We just changed how new items are <strong>added</strong> to the API (e.g., someone has to manually approve them before they get added, so we end up with less of <a href="https://api.guildwars2.com/v2/items/6">these</a> and <a href="https://api.guildwars2.com/v2/items/1">these</a>).</p></p>

<p>I just checked and it seems the only items that have been removed are these: <a href="https://gw2wbot.darthmaim.de/itemlist.php?id=39925,40898,40914,40922,40930,43948,43949">https://gw2wbot.darthmaim.de/itemlist.php?id=39925,40898,40914,40922,40930,43948,43949</a>. (Those are the item ids my updater for gw2treasures logs when trying to update all items.)</p></p>

<p>Well, that’s somewhat unfortunate.</p>
<p>I’ll try to get this fixed in some reasonable amount of time; at least so items returned via the inventory endpoints are always available (since that seems to make sense).</p></p>

<p>A couple more example of items that are currently not available but will be covered by your merchant fix<img src="/include/images/smilies/smile.png"></p>
<p>Aquatic Helms (quite popular, I presume)<br>
4481/4482/4483 (Gavbeorn Breather Light/Medium/Heavy or something like that, I don’t remember which one is which)<br>
64623 – Iron Tailpipe Bandana</p>
<p>Consumable:<br>
Karka Egg Omelet (36724), Mordrem Extraction Devices (68608)</p></p>

<p>
<p>I have a couple more examples too, maybe it can help devs figuring out what needs to be added.</p>
<p>- Mordremoth’s Bane Guild Decoration (43993)<br>
- Portal to the Heart of Maguuma (69648)<br>
- Merchant items: Harpy Feathers (8764), Order of Whispers Spy Kit (8801), Endless Mordrem Troll Tonic (68520),  some cultural armors, some weapons that can be bought for badges in WvW, …</p>
<p>It looks like merchant items are a really big chunk of the issue. Looking forward for that fix <img src="/include/images/smilies/smile.png"></p></p>

<p>
<p>Okay, so I think the approach that we’re gonna take for the missing items is — whenever an item is returned from /v2/account/bank or /v2/characters, it’ll be added to the items whitelist. I think this is a fairly safe approach — if you’ve got it in your inventory then there’s no benefit to hiding it (since … you already have access to it).</p>
<p>This change won’t go live until the patch after next, unfortunately, so you’ll just have to bear with us until then <img src="/include/images/smilies/sad.png"></p></p>

<p>Sounds good enough for me<img src="/include/images/smilies/smile.png"><br>
And items in “beta” character slot should probably be fine too, right? As people will probably post screenshots/whatnot anyway. Hopefully beta items don’t clash IDs with regular ones.</p>
