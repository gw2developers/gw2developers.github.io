While obviously I could go out of the game and switch it manually of course my first thought was to wonder if I could do it programmatically. Is there a call that will give me the area for a given ip (ie, the one I am on which I can get by looking at my network connections). Even better, are there fixed ip ranges for different maps or the same area?</p>","arenanet":false}]}
