This is also how it stores that information. I figure this is what the API is going to be accessing – the data stored in the templates. If a particular combination isn’t written up in template form, but is explained verbally (like this stuff probably is), the API isn’t going to see it and won’t be able to report it.</p>","arenanet":false},{"pubDate":"2016-07-07T04:02:21.000Z","guid":"http://forum-en.guildwars2.com/forum/community/api/Is-it-possible-to-get-mystic-forge-recipes/6235129","author":"Aidan Savage.2078","body":"\n<p>Though it does bring up an interesting conundrum- should it just be recipes that have defined (semi-defined for promotions n stuff) inputs and outputs (ie <em>actual</em> recipes that use the forge as the “workstation”), or should it be all mf recipes that are currently known on the wiki? For ones such as the random forging of equipment, I understand why those you would be reluctant to do. That’s partially why I suggested having those recipes essentially be generic in format:</p>\n<pre><code>\n//Mystic Forge recipe\n{\ntype: \"Exotic Weapon\",\noutput_item_type: \"Weapon\", //this format would necessitate a couple new fields probably,\n// but should be workable, being a new endpoint\noutput_item_count: 1,\ningredients: [\n{\ninput_item_type: \"Weapon\",\ninput_item_quality: \"Exotic\",\ncount: 4\n},\n],\nid: XYZ,\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>Recipes for the random forging would have two “duplicate recipes” as a result of being able to get a given quality level by using an equal quality, or the one immediately preceding it. This would mean that, instead of 9999999999999999999999999999999 recipes, you’d have…. 19×2×4plus19 for specific weapons (2 for each quality level besides basic, just 1), and then 9 “generic” ones that are basically 4 random weapons of a given quality. Armor is…. 18×2×4plus18 and the 9 generic as well I believe. Trinkets are similar as well. Still a hefty amount of work, but substantially easier than having to itemize everything.</p>\n<p>edit: stupid shortcut formatting</p>","arenanet":false},{"pubDate":"2016-07-06T20:17:55.000Z","guid":"http://forum-en.guildwars2.com/forum/community/api/Is-it-possible-to-get-mystic-forge-recipes/6234710","author":"Lawton Campbell.8517","body":"\n<p>Uhh, was posting before coffee and forgot to create a tracking issue for this.
