<p>Was just spending some time working on my GW2 tool and found the following isn’t returning ANY results:</p>

<p>Author of <a href="http://wvwintel.com">WvW Intelligence</a> here.</p>
<p>Definitely appears to be an API issue. I’ve updated my site to better indicate the errors that are occurring.</p>
<p>I might even speculate that the China severs are being added to the world names API. Who knows?<img src="/include/images/smilies/smile.png"></p></p>

<p>I’m a bit disappointed that this has been going on for 4 days now and we haven’t even gotten acknowledgement of the issue.</p>

<p>Hi All, thank you for the report.  Turns out there were more APIs affected by megaservers that I originally thought.  I am working on a fix and hope to have it out shortly.</p></p>

<p>Don’t take this the wrong way, and it’s entirely my own opinion, but I don’t think you should expect an answer (or indication) from ANet on the state of your domain renewals. Even still, these questions should be sent directly to ANet’s community managers, and not blindly posted on forum threads.</p>
<p>It’s a bit…ummm…not their problem? More explicitly, they (or any company in a similar position) aren’t beholden to your particular business needs because they’ve provided public APIs.</p>
<p>Again, these thoughts are my own. I would expect that if dev energy <em>is</em> spent on this forum, it would be focused on only those discussions which are universally relevant to all API developers.</p></p>

<p>
<p>No they don’t have to decide whether I should renew my domain or not. <br>
No they aren’t beholden on what you call my particular business.</p>
<p>But they probably know whether they have mid term plans of reworking the events API to make it work with MegaServers.<br>
And API users (probably not only me) need info about it so that we can decide whether to renew domain names or not; info which imho Anet should give hints about.</p>
<p>I know that can’t promise "we"ll make event API 2.0 in 08/2014".<br>
But they can say either <br>
- <em>events will probably not have a new API now, we’re sorry MegaServer system broke a few sites for good</em><br>
OR<br>
- <em>we [may / are talking about / have plans for / don’t know yet if ] release an Event API based on MegaServers that could be used to adapt sites that were using the old API. No promise, it’s up to you to decide if you want to renew your domain in case this new API ends up being released</em></p></p>

<p>If you just use some critical thinking, it’s pretty obvious that the current way megaservers work would not be amenable to event-tracking. How do you know what megaserver shard you’re on? If the API tells you that shard #4 has X event up, how do you reasonably get yourself onto that shard?</p>
<p>Any realistically useful implementation of the API would require nontrivial changes or added features to megaservers, so I highly doubt anything will happen in the near future.</p></p>

<p>The API fixes will go out with our upcoming 5/20 release.  I wasn’t sure of the date until recently.</p>
<p>Regarding a megaserver-compatible live events API:  For a few reasons, there are no plans to build this in the short/medium term, unfortunately.</p></p>

<p>Ah rats!  Yes, turns out there was another aspect of megaservers I didn’t understand and wasn’t apparent in the development environment.  We will need to temporarily disable that API until I can get it fixed for real.</p></p>

<p>Good to see you already posted that, I was about to point that out aswell, seeing how i was going to use that api to make use of the wvw matches api. Guess I will have to settle for a static list for now.</p>
<p>Megaserver really does more harm than good. ._.</p></p>

<p>Please give us the (dynamic) events api. It’s a powerfull tool for people to keep track on collection specific events. It is a positive way people stick to the game. Now you travel to a place in the hope that specific event is live. If i have to wait to long, i leave the area, resulting indisconfort and more easily leaving the game totaly. So please make it easy to see which event is running where. Keep you’re beautyfull game running the way gamers like it…not the way investers want it.</p></p>

<p>Problem is:<br>
- You currently have no way of telling what megaserver shard you are currently on and hence cant give that as a parameter to the events api<br>
- Even if you knew that, you wouldnt have a way to travel to a specific megaserver shard where the event is currently running, ultimately making you wait around anyways</p>
<p>I do agree with you though. I would like to see this fixed sometime soon too.</p></p>

<p>Type /ip     <br>
That’s your megaserver.</p>
<p>The other problem is insurmountable, though :/</p></p>

<p>I meant in an automatic way, such as grabbing the world/shard_id and map_id from the mumble plugin and feeding it into another application.<br>
Sadly, the mumble plugin currently returns rubbish when it comes to that, and we have no official events api we could feed that into even if we had it.</p>
<p>I was aware of the manual way of finding out what ip you are on, but that still isnt the same as a shard_id i suppose.</p></p>

<p>
<p>It could potentially work that way.</p>
<p>Consider something like map_details API which tracks available megaserver IPs for that particular map. map_details for Dry Top contains all instance of Dry Top currently running. Use that same IP to access event_details API which contains a list of all events currently running, including an IP field which ties into the instance the event is running on.</p>
<p>If that makes any sense.</p>
<p>There’s no way to travel to a particular megaserver instance (unless you know someone on the instance), but at least the API will allow tracking of events in your current instance of whichever zone map you’re in, since not all of them appear on the map.</p>
<p>It’ll probably still be a problem of keeping track of multiple instances of every map and keeping track of the IP.</p></p>
