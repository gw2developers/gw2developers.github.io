<p>Hey everyone, so i try to make a guide for scribes with the API but when i’m searching</p>
<p>this for exemple on the API : <a href="https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Scribing:_Guild_Ballista">https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Scribing:_Guild_Ballista</a></p>
<p>i found the item guild ballista : <a href="https://api.guildwars2.com/v2/items.json?id=42003">https://api.guildwars2.com/v2/items.json?id=42003</a></p>
<p>but not the scribes recipe so it’s because of me or because they don’t update the API ?</p>
<p>Thanks to have read and sorry for my error when i’m writing english is not my first language<img src="/include/images/smilies/wink.png"></p></p>

<p>
<p>Hmm, either no one’s made a Guild Ballista with the new scribe recipe, or there’s a bug on my end.</p>
<p>I’m guessing it’s a bug.</p></p>

<p>
<p>I haven’t seen any of the guild related Scribe recipes in the API, even though I crafted multiple types of the banners myself, as well as the odd decoration. All these are items that get put (indirectly) into the guild storage. Hopefully this info helps you find the bug.</p></p>

<p>Yup, found the bug. Not sure when I’m going to get the fix out; not sure I can get it in for the Dec. 1st release <img src="/include/images/smilies/sad.png"></p></p>

<p>Recipes won’t appear in the API until they’re crafted at least once (and then there’s a manual step where I press a button after making sure there’s no <a href="http://db.dulfy.net/item/1">junk data</a>). It’ll get there eventually.</p></p>

<p>
<p>There are lvl 400 scribes out there though, so I assume there are recipes that have been done at least once to get to 400 and therefore a possible guide?</p>
<p>If Xanthic says there are still gaps in his guide, then is this the manual step thats missing from them being added to the API? ( I know there are ones that may not have been done once yet but I am assuming they are due to the insane cost which wouldnt factor into a scribe guide anyway).</p>

<p>I’m not sure how/why the missing recipes aren’t appearing. By my reading, they should have been put in the whitelist queue if they’ve been used (and I have a hard time believing they haven’t been used). Made a <a href="https://github.com/arenanet/api-cdi/issues/206">new github issue for this</a> and I’m going to spend some time today rooting around in the log files to try to figure out what’s going on.</p></p>

<p>
<p>To the best of my knowledge there are not gaps in my guides related to items missing from the API.  My current issue is items that exist as non-TP-able items, such as Crystalline Vials, that need to be manually added on my end.</p>
<p><a href="http://gw2crafts.net/scribe.html">http://gw2crafts.net/scribe.html</a> (for current status)</p>
<p>I haven’t had the time until today(since the introduction of scribe) to do the context switch necessary to track down issues.</p>
<p>[edit] Actually I have a problem with how “guild_ingredients” were added to recipes as well.  Now I need to create a lookup table so I can find the item_id from an  upgrade_id.  Having to check for this new field and not having the item_id of the guild ingredient in the “ingredients” section is &gt;.&gt; as it also means the recipe list needs to be processed at least twice.</p>
<p>[edit2] nm looks like there is an item id on things that have them <a href="https://api.guildwars2.com/v2/guild/upgrades/352">https://api.guildwars2.com/v2/guild/upgrades/352</a> that I can work backwards from.</p></p>

<p>
<p>Actually, there are gaps that break things for me.</p>
<p>This recipe creates an item <a href="http://api.guildwars2.com/v2/recipes.json?ids=10510">http://api.guildwars2.com/v2/recipes.json?ids=10510</a></p>
<p>This item “doesn’t exist” in <a href="https://api.guildwars2.com/v2/items.json?ids=76707">https://api.guildwars2.com/v2/items.json?ids=76707</a></p>
<p>But it exists in <a href="https://api.guildwars2.com/v2/guild/upgrades/291">https://api.guildwars2.com/v2/guild/upgrades/291</a></p>
<p>What is the intended behaviour here?  Should I be able to find item ids that don’t exist in the items endpoint that map to an item that actually exists and would have that id if it was in the items endpoint?</p></p>

<p>I mostly didn’t want to break existing applications by making output_item_id conditional.</p>
<p>Whenever output_upgrade_id is present, output_item_id is <strong>not</strong> used. There are some placeholder items that are relics of times gone by (for the interested, they’re like “Immediate” type items which are consumed before entering your inventory), but it was probably a mistake including them.</p>
<p>The output_upgrade_id references /v2/guild/upgrades.</p></p>

<p>Thanks for the followup.</p>
<p><a href="https://api.guildwars2.com/v2/guild/upgrades/352">https://api.guildwars2.com/v2/guild/upgrades/352</a> A vendor item that goes immediately into the guild inventory with an item_id on its page that is valid for the items endpoint</p>
<p><a href="https://api.guildwars2.com/v2/guild/upgrades/291">https://api.guildwars2.com/v2/guild/upgrades/291</a> a crafted item that differs only in where it enters the guild inventory from that does not have an item_id on its page (although the recipe that creates it lists one)</p>
<p>I realize you are talking about recipes, so this discrepant behaviour doesn’t apply.  However needing to juggle two item lists(because they have overlapping id numbers so they can’t be merged) just to get all the relevant item names(in multiple languages) is too expensive for me(in terms of development time).  If the item_id on the recipe page is “invalid” anyways(as in it is superseded by output_upgrade_id) and won’t be added to the items endpoint, it would be nice if it was removed outright (from that recipe) or the items endpoint gave a useful error message.</p>
<p>Either way I’ll leave it to someone else to created automated scribe guides.</p></p>

<p>I’m of the opinion that the endpoint shouldn’t dump out bogus values; I’ve made a <a href="https://github.com/arenanet/api-cdi/issues/209">github issue</a> and will probably remove it at some point. My original concern was that removing it would break existing applications, but in hindsight, leaving it in breaks existing applications in a more subtle and more confusing manner.</p>

<p>Sorry to hear that. I’m sure that many (besides myself) were looking forward to gw2crafts.net including a scribing guide.</p></p>
