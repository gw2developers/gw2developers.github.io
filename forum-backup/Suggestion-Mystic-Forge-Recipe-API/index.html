<p>Would it be possible to get an official api that offers information about all currently known mystic forge recipes? I would assume it could be a much easier version of the recipe_details api, so to speak. All it would really need would be a corresponding ID, what it produces and what and how many ingredients it uses.</p>
<p>Also, i would like to know if people here would actually find this useful, as i wouldnt mind doing the dirty research work and provide a suitable api of my own for the time being.</p>
<p>Let me know what you guys think about this.</p></p>

<p>One point would be, that i didnt think of said sticky. :x other reason would be that i would like to know if you, my fellow codemonkeys ( or codequaggans if that is prefered) would appreciate it if i made the effort of dishing one out for now, if noone did so already. :P</p></p>

<p>I would absolutely love to see recipe_details for the mystic forge.  I want it so much, I went and manually made a bunch of the them.  If you want, I could create a text file with all of them in json format, similar to how the recipe_details.json looks.<br>
specifically, I have:<br>
legendaries<br>
gifts<br>
clovers (it uses the average amount of the ingredients it takes)<br>
mystic weapons<br>
the other SP weapons (the ones that use eldritch scroll)<br>
superior siege<br>
Recipe: Box of Armors (I haven’t confirmed them yet, that would take more sp than I have, but theoretically they’re right)<br>
Recipe: Feast of Food / Recipe: Pot of Food / Recipe: Tray of Food (I haven’t confirmed them yet, that would take more sp than I have, but theoretically they’re right)<br>
material promotions (the output_item_count is the average you get)<br>
a few other misc things (like mystic salvage kit and improved experience booster)</p>
<p>782 total recipes</p>
<p>I don’t have everything, such as:<br>
minis<br>
tonics<br>
limited-time recipes (captains council commendations, for example)<br>
all of the “4 rates -&gt; 1 random rare” type recipes</p>
<p>but I do have a simple way of generating them (basically just typing out the names and amounts into a function and it finds the right data_id’s from the database).  or what’s also fun is copy/paste a table from the wiki and find/replace<img src="/include/images/smilies/wink.png"></p>
<p>So, if there is interest in this, let me know and I can put it all together and publish what I have.  And if there is interest in the parts I don’t have, let me know and I’ll work to complete it (also please provide any resources you have that name what all the recipes are)</p></p>

<p>I have a small database containing all Crafting Material Mystic Forge recipes! If anyone is interested I could send the SQL script?</p></p>
