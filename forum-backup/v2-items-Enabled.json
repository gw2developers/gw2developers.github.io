If you want some data to start with, here are all <a href=\"https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/75481541/gw2/item_names.json\">item names</a> in the API at this moment.</p>\n<p>Also, it’s a very bad idea to fetch every single item at once. If you need multiple resources, fetch for multiple at once <a href=\"http://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/API:2#Accessing_resources\">using the `ids` parameter</a>. That reduces the requests you need to do <strong>by a lot</strong> and results in a much better performance (for both your client as well as the API server—HTTP requests are expensive!).</p>\n<p>And if you don’t actually know which item ids you are looking for, instead of fetching all ids and then querying the information for all those ids, just <a href=\"http://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/API:2#Paging\">use paging</a> on the resource directly.</p>","arenanet":false},{"pubDate":"2014-09-26T10:48:26.000Z","guid":"http://forum-en.guildwars2.com/forum/community/api/v2-items-Enabled/4446777","author":"Kasoki.7013","body":"\n<p>Is there still no way to search for items by name?</p>\n<p>The only way to do this (at least as far as I know) is to ask the server about every single item like this: <a href=\"http://jsfiddle.net/1zkftj7y/1/\">http://jsfiddle.net/1zkftj7y/1/</a></p>","arenanet":false},{"pubDate":"2014-09-26T05:59:30.000Z","guid":"http://forum-en.guildwars2.com/forum/community/api/v2-items-Enabled/4446409","author":"darthmaim.6017","body":"\n<p>Awesome!
