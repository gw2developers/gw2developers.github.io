<p>A common request in the dungeons forums is for a way to figure out which dungeon paths a player has completed, both all-time and since last reset. Seems like a pretty simple feature, but asking for anything dungeon-related is a non-starter for the in-game development team. Perhaps our wonderful API team could come to our rescue?</p>
<p>Would it be possible to expose an authenticated endpoint that shows:</p>
<p>1) Which dungeon paths have been completed for all time? (relevant for dungeon master achievement)<br>
2) Which dungeon paths have been completed since the last reset? (useful for making sure no paths are missed in a daily tour)</p>
<p>I can put together a more formal RFC if needed (let me know), but first, is this information that you guys have access to?</p>
<p>Both of these usecases could be covered simply providing a timestamp of the most recent completion.</p></p>

<p>Let’s just say this is not a suggestion you’re not familiarized with Anet,  Mr. Hrouda probably left some feedback there on how to pursue this.</p>
<p>Surely there has to be some kind of leftover there that could be used  or transformed into pushing this into an API, right?</p></p>

<p>Well, St. Hrouda was likely looking into adding an in-game UI for it, probably somewhere in the hero panel’s achievement section. The API guys may or may not have access to anything he left, and that’s assuming that his 2+ year old, aborted work-in-progress-from-a-former-developer patch that he made against a very outdated codebase is miraculously still around somewhere ;-)</p>
<p>(and that’s assuming he even got a chance to start working on it before they laid him off).</p>
<p>Anyway, I have confidence in the API team. They’re not your everyday red-posters ;-)</p></p>

<p>Thanks for the heads up! I think my request would supersede that, as providing timestamps would also provide the “did they do story mode?” information<img src="/include/images/smilies/colondee.png"></p>
<p>If they have access to this information, that is<img src="/include/images/smilies/wink.png"></p></p>
