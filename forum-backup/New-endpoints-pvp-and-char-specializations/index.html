<p>
<p>Just turned on a couple of new endpoints:</p>
<ul>
	<li>/v2/pvp/stats (<a href="https://api.guildwars2.com/v2/pvp/stats?access_token=51969C37-FA95-744C-BB29-075C684EBD33C086D050-124E-4575-994B-304F23DA6F70">example</a>, <a href="https://github.com/arenanet/api-cdi/pull/41">github</a>)</li>
	<li>/v2/pvp/games (<a href="https://api.guildwars2.com/v2/pvp/games?access_token=51969C37-FA95-744C-BB29-075C684EBD33C086D050-124E-4575-994B-304F23DA6F70">example</a>, <a href="https://github.com/arenanet/api-cdi/pull/89">github</a>)</li>
	<li>/v2/character/:id/specializations (<a href="https://api.guildwars2.com/v2/characters/Shieldclaws/specializations?access_token=51969C37-FA95-744C-BB29-075C684EBD33C086D050-124E-4575-994B-304F23DA6F70">example</a>, <a href="https://github.com/arenanet/api-cdi/pull/85">github</a>)</li>
</ul>
<p><b>/v2/pvp/stats</b></p>
<p>Requires “pvp” permission.</p>
<p>Dumps a bunch of aggregate pvp data — basically some of the stuff that’s displayed in the in-game UI. Some of it’s missing (e.g., fav map, etc). Consider this an initial pass — going to try to add more details here at some point.</p>
<p><b>/v2/pvp/games</b></p>
<p>Requires “pvp” permission.</p>
<p>Dumps the most recent pvp games played. This is a very <b>very</b> initial implementation; there honestly isn’t much useful here right now. There’s a lot more I want to do with this endpoint, but data needs to be plumbed through multiple services owned by multiple teams (who are all already busy) so it’s going to take some time.</p>
<p>As an important note, this endpoint only serves the <b>10 most recent</b> games (that have occurred within the last 30 days, IIRC). I realize this is terrible and would like to make it a bit more reasonable, but it’s gonna take some time to get better data retention. Highly recommend any applications interested in this data use a server component which periodically polls+persists the endpoint data.</p>
<p><b>/v2/characters/:id/specializations</b></p>
<p>Requires “builds” permission.</p>
<p>The specializations are available in both /v2/characters (in the .specializations field) and in /v2/characters/:id/specializations. Data is provided for all of PvE, PvP and WvW builds (specializations can be cross-referenced against /v2/specializations, traits against /v2/traits which I just turned on).</p>
<p>Skills and PvP equipment will be coming at some point in the future but probably not this month (sorry!).</p>
<p>Questions/comments?</p></p>

<p>Hmm, apparently I have 10 matches listed, and the dates range from 2015-07-12T02:27:08.000Z to 2015-07-14T03:09:30.000Z. So it would seem that the retention is higher than 30 days <img src="/include/images/smilies/smile.png"></p>
<p>Edit: A question, what are the possibilities of the results? Currently I have Buy, Defeat, Victory and Forfeit. And what triggers what to show up?<br>
Edit2: I also saw that I’ve had a couple matches of which neither team has reached 500 points. These matches have the map 1011, I’m assuming that’s Battle of the Champion’s Dusk? It’s not yet listed in /v2/maps.</p></p>

<p>Eww gross, I missed a “Buy” typo coming from our upstream data source. I’m going to patch that to “Bye”. There’s also “Desertion”.</p>

<p>I’ll whitelist the map in a sec, pretty sure that’s the stronghold map. When neither team has 500 points it means the timer was hit.</p></p>

<p>Hey Lawton,</p>
<p>is it possible to add the Character ID (next to profession) to the PVP-Game-API? With only having the profession, there is no possibility to check with which character the person played, if he has more than one character per profession (2 guards for example).</p>
<p>That would be super cool<img src="/include/images/smilies/smile.png"></p>
<p>Greetings<br>
Chris</p></p>

<p>
<p>I have a few questions about how the pvp/stats API works. Let’s talk about <a href="http://i.imgur.com/E8O837W.png">these stats from one of my users</a> (raw data <a href="http://pastebin.com/LvxX9EVX">here</a>).</p>
<ul>
	<li>Do “Solo Ranked” and “Team Ranked” get added together for the “Ranked” ladder? If yes, what are the 49 “Ranked” matches, that are additional if you add “solo” and “team” together? Based on the raw data: (282+288+2+1)-(75+74+185+190) = 49. What exactly are the definitions of these ladders?</li>
	<li>Assuming that “solo ranked” and “team ranked” are included in the “ranked” matches, the aggregate number does not match up with the ladders number: (567+503+6+23+17)-(282+288+2+1+213+157+6+21+16) = 130. Are these custom arenas?</li>
	<li>What is the “none” ladder for?</li>
</ul>
<p>Edit: While I am at it, the timezone offeset for the played matches seems wrong. The match I played a few minutes ago is dated “2015-09-10T18:34:54.000Z”, when it should be “2015-09-10T10:34:54.000Z” or “2015-09-10T18:44:54+08:00”.</p>
<p>Thanks for all the new APIs, it’s a blast building stuff with it.<img src="/include/images/smilies/smile.png"></p></p>

	<li>Do “Solo Ranked” and “Team Ranked” get added together for the “Ranked” ladder? If yes, what are the 49 “Ranked” matches, that are additional if you add “solo” and “team” together? Based on the raw data: (282+288+2+1)-(75+74+185+190) = 49. What exactly are the definitions of these ladders?</li>
	<li>Assuming that “solo ranked” and “team ranked” are included in the “ranked” matches, the aggregate number does not match up with the ladders number: (567+503+6+23+17)-(282+288+2+1+213+157+6+21+16) = 130. Are these custom arenas?</li>
</ul></div></blockquote>
<p>So, back in the days of glory there were two game modes — soloq and team (“solo ranked” and “team ranked”). These are distinct from the modes we have now — unranked and ranked. New accounts won’t have the former but old accounts have their old data still in the system.</p>
<p>AFAIK custom arenas are tracked in the other aggregates, but not in the ladders.</p>

<p>I’m not entirely sure actually. I think it’s debris from a bug at some point.</p>

<p>Wow, really good.</p>
<p>I find especially useful for ranked and unranked games a better separation in the latest matches</p>
<p>It would be really interesting tracking roster compositions for every game (which profession people used, especially for ranked/unranked) and the stats pvp team lately added in the game (like total damage done etc.) that we can hardly analyze at the end of the match.</p>
<p>Other super useful thing it would be the roster size for ranked and unranked games, example grp of 3 people + 2 soloers for every team.</p>
<p>I think with the pvp leagues incoming the entire section could be really interesting and useful to monitor progressions.</p>
<p>Good job</p></p>

<p>thanks for your reply. So I wait some time and hope, that this feature comes at a time not so far far away…<img src="/include/images/smilies/smile.png"></p>
<p>In addition to this, it would be super cool, if the api delivers the team- and enemy-team composition (only the professions, not the character names/id’s).</p>

<p>Does the game keep track “Top X” awards internally? eg: Top Condition Damage Received.</p>
<p>I’m curious if this will ever be available in the API.</p>
<p>It’d be neat to get it via pvp/games, but a counter in pvp/stats would be cool as well.</p></p>

<p>That stuff really should be available in game for at least the last match you were in.  As it is you have about 5 seconds to look at it before it’s gone forever.</p></p>

<p>Yeah, AFAIK it’s currently only tracked by the map instance server and not persisted anywhere.  Might take a look at the current state of all the pvp stuff next week, I really want match rosters.</p></p>

<p>The aggregate data for <a href="https://account.arena.net/applications">https://account.arena.net/applications</a> is incorrect/out of date.</p>
<p>My current PvP stats from the in game window are different<br>

<p>This difference of some number exists across multiple API keys and professions.</p>

<p>Which in-game data are you looking at?</p>
<p>Note that the in-game UI considers a “bye” as a victory and a “forfeit” as a defeat when it displays aggregates — that might be the cause of the discrepancy. Both the in-game UI and the API are pulling from the same internal API, so it’s unlikely they’re out-of-sync.</p></p>

<p>Can we get an idea of the data coming to the pvp api in the coming months? I’m not looking for a date, more so an idea of what will/will not be added long term. The info well help drive the design of my website.</p>
<p>Specifically things like:<br>
Account names for all players<br>
Per player score<br>
The detailed stats tab<br>
Builds<br>
League info</p></p>

<p>Ideally I’d like all of those things in (and more), but I can’t really commit to features or a timeline. Especially when it’s the competitive team doing all the backend work for me on those parts <img src="/include/images/smilies/lion.png"></p></p>
