Once the temple is taken, the event’s not going to change status. I’d guess you’d need to keep track of the status of any quest required to keep the temple open as well, and probably do some work with that. I haven’t had enough coffee yet today to think about it past that though.</p>","arenanet":false},{"pubDate":"2013-06-10T13:08:58.000Z","guid":"http://forum-en.guildwars2.com/forum/community/api/How-to-test-if-a-temple-is-open/2186635","author":"Snowcub.3206","body":"\n<p>You need to take the Defend Event (ill try and find out the id) into account.
