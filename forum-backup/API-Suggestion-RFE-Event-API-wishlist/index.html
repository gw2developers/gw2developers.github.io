<p>I think that theese enchancements to Event api would be … awesome:</p>
<ul>
	<li>List of current event goals and their status (i.e. boss health, x/x mob waves defeated, area capture progress, countdown timer, percentage of items still needed for bring me items events, health of defended npcs, etc etc…)<br>
 * List of map markers that event shows on map (position and icon type)<br>
 * List of areas marked on map – the painterly circles and arrows in game (position, size, type)<br>
 * Encompassing Meta event</li>
</ul>
<p>I would love to make (or make someone else make) full browser of events with proper display on map.</p>
<p>I would also love to make “analysis” of coverage of map by events.</p></p>

<p>
<p>That is what I would want too.  Perhaps even if someone can create an overlay when you bring up the map in the game, so you don’t have to be close to a particular area in order to find out that an event is active there.  You can find out all active events just by bringing up the map.</p>
<p>If it is too much work to provide that, perhaps the community can help out by scavenging for such information and consolidating them to share with everyone.</p>
<p>I have many ideas, just don’t have the time to code them all. <img src="/include/images/smilies/smile.png"></p></p>

<p>Snapshot is better than nothing – event with boss health at 90% and 10% is very different from player perspective.</p>
<p>Some events – mostly escort ones can happen through half a length of zone.</p>
<p>I am also interested in analysis. For example, “event density” statistics, natural flows of zone. How objectives are completed. How long do competition events stay active before player start doing them, such stuff.</p></p>

<p>
<p>The difference between 90% and 10% health can be 5 seconds for most event “bosses”.  The difference between 10% and 90% complete for many “fill-up” objectives can also be very short, if there’s only 1 player there and he turns in 50 items at once.  In other words, snapshots of progress bars are unreliable indicators of the true situation, and would require constant polling to keep them meaningful.</p></p>

<p>Balth may be an exception, and its one that players will want the hp for.</p>
<p>If he’s over 90% hp, you have time to WP over and run out to join.  If he’s at 50%, you might have time.  20% – don’t bother.</p>
<p>Other meta- event bosses will be like that, and its the meta events that most players will care about.</p></p>

<p>Oh yes I agree that snapshot is better than nothing.  Which is why if ArenaNet can provide the location, great, otherwise the community can help out to give an approximate averaged location, since having an averaged-out approximate location is also better than nothing.</p></p>

<p>There are also many multistage events – for example, Mordnirr chieftain which has event with three phases.</p>
<p>My experience of bring-me-items events is that they usually sit unattended, which makes them very reliable for completing various event dailies/monthlies, if there is any progress, it is from player who tags event with one item and then works on collecting rest of items, people seem to very rarely get into collecting without ensuring that they have tagged it. Also, some gathering events make players bring bundles, which results in smooth progress bar.</p>
<p>Also: I would like it if events had group event flag.</p>
<p>And, if possible, information how many players are affecting scaling.</p></p>

<p>
<p>After looking through the events api’s the thing I would like the most for now is a json with meta information and coordinate rectangle of the orange circle – just the starting position is fine.<br>
For example, the Frozen Maw meta has 7? events registered to it. As it sits, I have to track and watch each of those for changes to know if it is even still up which is fine but I have to find each one of them in the event data and know for certain they actually are for the Frozen Maw meta. To do this manually for 1600+ events is insane.</p>
<p>Perhaps just a [flags] with the meta event name in the events data would work as well.<br>
Would be easier if the event_names.json structure was more like:<br>
</p><pre><code>{
"event_names": [
	{"id":"another random string associated with this event",
	"meta_name":"The Frozen Maw",
	"coords":[x,y],

<p>I would just wish for a change in the filter part of the url for /v1/events.json</p>
<p>I would really love if event_id take an array of ids instead of only one event, this would save server load and request counts/connections to do a query on say 10 events. you could list these in an array and the server filters and queries one to many events depending on the list of parameters.</p>
<p>This would make it easy to make a quick list of a few events you want to keep a watchful eye on<img src="/include/images/smilies/wink.png"></p></p>

<p>
<p>Now that the new daily quest system is in place, it would be great to be able to see what today’s PvE dailies are before I get home, so I know whether to budget time for them or just a quick login before moving to other things. (I’m not sure if the PvP ones would be useful to folks who do that; the WvW ones seem generic enough that one wouldn’t plan one’s evening around them).</p>
<p>I’d love to have my favorite world event tracker highlight in some what which world boss is the Boss of the Day, but it would also be nice to see what the other PvE dailies are because I need to make a call on whether I’ll be spending an hour or two, or just a couple minutes, on GW2 on the average weeknight. When 2 of the 4 are, like last night, “daily fractal” and “daily fractal 1-10”, and I don’t have the time to run a fractal, the decision becomes trivial. But normally it’s a matter of whether the designated world boss is going to be up during the window that I can play.</p></p>

<p>I have a couple ideas but I don’t know enough about how the dailies are decided or how they track progress/completion to make any solid suggestions. Any bits of information on those would help a lot (if that’s under your jurisdiction).</p></p>

<p>
<p>I actually have no idea how the new daily system works — the old one was on a rotation. I would blindly assume that the new system is still deterministic, but that doesn’t preclude the dailies from being randomly selected (e.g., via a synchronized RNG).</p></p>

<p>
<p>By the looks of it they are set up for each day of the month from 1 through 31, so they’ll be the same for a particular day of the month unless a designer changes the rotation.  Lower level players are given alternates when they require being a high level.</p>
