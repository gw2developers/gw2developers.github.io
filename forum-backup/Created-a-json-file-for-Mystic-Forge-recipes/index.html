<p>
<p>Hello!</p>
<p>Currently with the API we have absolutely no way to get Mystic Forge recipes.</p>
<p>I needed them for something I’m working on, so I went ahead and made a JSON file that contains most of the recipes.<br>
It took me a while to get all of this data together and there might be mistakes so let me know if you find any.</p>
<p><del><a href="http://nailek.net/gw2/resources/mysticforge-recipes.json">http://nailek.net/gw2/resources/mysticforge-recipes.json</a></del></p>
<p>The format I’m using is exactly the same as the one for the <a href="https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/API:2/recipes">v2/recipes endpoint</a> (except for the “name” field I added).</p>
<p>Feel free to copy the file, change the format, read it out loud to your pet quaggan (?), … I hope someone will do something cool with this <img src="/include/images/smilies/smile.png">.</p>
<p>Happy coding! ~</p>

<p>You’re only half done.</p>
<p>There’s so much more you can put in and get out from the forge. Where are the tonics? Upgrade recipes? Ascended back items?</p></p>

<p>I offered to compile these in another post a few months ago but no one seemed interested at the time. Looks like that’s changed, so, ta-da!<br>
Here’s mine I made:<br>
without names: <a href="http://www.gw2profits.com/json/forge">http://www.gw2profits.com/json/forge</a><br>
with names: <a href="http://www.gw2profits.com/json/forge?include=name">http://www.gw2profits.com/json/forge?include=name</a><br>
This has all 793 of them: material promotion, mystic and eldritch scroll weapons, legendaries, gifts, siege, clovers, mists essences, armor set recipes, feast recipes, some misc.<br>
I copied your format best I could.<br>
material promotion is an average. started with estimates from Egg Baron then did my own research for T1.<br>
For Reaper of Souls, I used item_id of ‘-1’ :P<br>
mystic clovers are also averages, but the other way around. Thinking about it, I should probably invert those… so it gives the recipe for each time you do it, but it only products 0.3 clovers or something like that. I was going off the wiki for how many of each was required to make 1 clover.<br>
the armor set recipes and feast recipes are mathematical estimates for how much wine, coin, and crystals are required. wiki has a range of how much is required, and I made a few at various ratings for more data points, then made a line that fit them as good as possible.  let me know if you find one that’s off :P I crafted a bunch of them, but that’s way too many to confirm by hand.</p>
<p>Thanks for your work! I look forward to adding them to my collection.  I didn’t do a single thing with minis or tonics or ascended myself – I was focused on things that could be sold on the TP.</p>
<p>edit: I updated the links above to include Chokapik’s recipes (now 850 recipes) as well as foraging sickle’s id and mystic clover to be the ingredients to make 1 but only output 0.31 clovers.  It was quite beautiful to see our duplicates side-by side with how similar they were<img src="/include/images/smilies/colondee.png"></p></p>

<p>Right, this thread: <a href="/forum-backup/Mystic-Forge-Recipes-2">https://forum-en.guildwars2.com/forum/community/api/Mystic-Forge-Recipes-2/5349805</a></p>
<p>I suggested, that you’d best put it into a public repository like GitHub so that anyone could contribute.<br>

<p>
<p>I don’t like GitHub :*(<br>
what you linked is fine, but most times someone links to there it’s just a folder of how-to instructions with no actual useful things.  could be just bad experiences.</p></p>

<p>GitHub is super easy and super simple to use – just create a repo and play a bit with it.<br>
Get the desktop client <a href="https://desktop.github.com/">https://desktop.github.com/</a> and a nice editor: <a href="https://atom.io/">https://atom.io/</a><br>
You will most likely never see the command line then (well, unless you really messed something up)<img src="/include/images/smilies/wink.png"></p></p>

was that only recentlyish they added it? It was already in my database of items, but definitely wasn't when I wrote the recipe that uses it.</p>

<p>I’m feeling in the discovery mood, so I’ll start working on mawdrey and mini llama.  then I’ll see what you mean about the tonics.</p></p>

<p>That’s amazing guys! <br>
In the long run, I agree that it would be nice to have it on github or something like that, especially if more recipes are added to the game. That’s not mandatory though. Nice work, Mystic! <img src="/include/images/smilies/colondee.png"></p>

<p>turns out only the ‘smells like singed fur and feathers’ mystery tonic (crystalline dust + vicious claw + vicious fang + water = 5 of them at artificer) is able to go in the mystic forge.  that makes it so easy<img src="/include/images/smilies/smile.png"><br>

<p>I did Mini Steamrider, Mini Steam Hulk, and Mini Steam Minotaur.  just made it 3 different recipes, all with the same ingredients. no idea how we should notate them as possible options. normal API doesn’t have this problem :P<br>
will post those in a sec…  want to finish fractal capacitors first.<br>
omg what a mess.  5 different items x 2 infusion slots (offensive/defensive), yet somehow beta and glowy have 20 different data_id instead of 10.<br>
I have found <a href="http://db.dulfy.net/search">http://db.dulfy.net/search</a> to be invaluable.<br>
what’s the difference between 37039 ([&amp;AgGvkAAA]) and 49381 ([&amp;AgHlwAAA])? and which one turns into 37049 ([&amp;AgG5kAAA]) and which 49391 ([&amp;AgHvwAAA])? Is it as obvious as it looks? what’s the difference between them?  only the last of these 4 am I able to link in game.<br>
also, what’s the difference between 37020 and 37025? I expect 37025 to be the real one, but then what is 37020 all about?</p></p>

<p>
<p>oh well, it’s at least close enough :P  I just put both of those options in there<br>
updated the json above<br>
text file with just Mini Steamrider, Mini Steam Hulk, Mini Steam Minotaur, fractal capacitors:<br>
note: Chokapik already had 2 of them, so be careful of duplicates. I think output_item_id 37035 (soldiers) differs from what I just produced… should probably have 37025 (soldiers) as an ingredient instead of 37029 (berserker).  I had wayyy too much time on my hands :P</p></p>

<p>I can help.</p>

<p>The first has a built in +5 agony infusion. This used to be the norm.</p>
<blockquote><div class="quotey"><p>and which one turns into 37049 ([&amp;AgG5kAAA]) and which 49391 ([&amp;AgHvwAAA])? Is it as obvious as it looks? what’s the difference between them?</p></div></blockquote>
<p>The difference here is the same. I couldn’t tell you if you could actually make 37049 any more. Whatever combination is in place to handle the legacy item may or may not have been updated to point to the replacement for its original product.</p>
<blockquote><div class="quotey"><p>also, what’s the difference between 37020 and 37025? I expect 37025 to be the real one, but then what is 37020 all about?</p></div></blockquote>
<p>These appear to be functionally identical, so I’ll draw your attention to a couple of other things. 37020 only appeared in the API within the last couple of months, while the rest have been around for more than a year. The capacitors are grouped in blocks of 5; 37020 starts off a block of 5 that is otherwise unviewable. There are similar blocks of 5 items of unviewable data in between blocks of capacitors. What you probably have here is some item data that somehow got exposed that shouldn’t have been. Maybe it has something to do with the beta, but I think it can be safely ignored for now.</p></p>

<p>So, I went ahead and confirmed by hand :P not all of them, but I put 1 or 2 in the forge at every rating 0-400 and wrote down how many coin, wine, and crystal would be required, then updated all the recipes to the correct values. like 50% were correct, most of rest were off by 1, a few were off by up to 4.  I updated the json files, they’re the same link as above:<br>

<p>Point 1: thx to all the great guys for work!<br>
2. Seems like it does not contain Halloween recipes, is that right? Any chances to see them added soon enough?<br>
3. I’m not sure if setting output to zero for low-chance recipes is a nice idea. Maybe multiply ingredients appropriately? (right now it is impossible to calculate statistically possible profit for such recipes)</p>
<p>For example it does not contain any recipes using item 36059 (Plastic Fangs): <a href="http://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Plastic_Fangs">http://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Plastic_Fangs</a></p></p>

<p>I added a couple recipes to my json files above (added nightfury) and corrected the unspoken curse error and mystic clover output_item_count (THANKS! any other bugs?<img src="/include/images/smilies/smile.png">), but moved the json files to a new location:<br>

<p>In a few hours (gym time!), I’ll add the recipes to convert between halloween currencies from <a href="https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Trick-or-Treat_Bag">https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Trick-or-Treat_Bag</a>.  are there any other halloween recipes to add?</p>
<p>what recipe has an output of 0? lowest I see is an output of 0.31 for clovers.  ohhhhhh, it was rounding.  1 sec…. fixed!</p></p>

<p>
<p>k, added a few more:<br>
convert chattering skull, nougat center and plastic fangs to each other. 6 recipes for each, different amounts for each recipe.<br>
candy corn cob from chattering skull, nougat center and plastic fangs and mini gwynefyrdd (lol)<br>
recipe: major/superior rune of mad king/sigil of night, 3 versions of each, for the different discipline weights</p>
<p>also, I changed the format of the ingredients to have item_id first, then count.  that makes more sense to me.  it shouldn’t affect anything if you use json_decode, but thought I’d mention it.</p></p>

<p>&gt;convert chattering skull, nougat center and plastic fangs to each other. 6 recipes for each, different amounts for each recipe.</p>
<p>Just docced those over the weekend. They’ve been around for at least a year, but as you can imagine, there’s not a lot of interest in a low yield recipe for a common item ;D</p>
<p>But if, come springtime, people get curious what a salvage kit is good for in the forge, now they’ll know.</p></p>

<p>Thank you very much.<br>
Then it was a single case with 0 output? My bad I haven’t checked it right away.<br>
Now I’ll have to switch from integers, hope no surprises (( (I’ve merged usual and MF recipes to one list, hence some problems)</p>
<p>Halloween recipes confirmed working, will notify if anything is missing.</p></p>

<p>
<p>the 0 output was the 1x mystic clover recipe.  for some reason when I first put that together I thought it would be good to round the output amounts, so 0.31 rounded to 0.  and the 10x recipe rounded 3.12 to 3.  took that out and it works fine.  just like the material promotions, the clover output is an average.</p></p>

<p>
<p>I made an update.<br>
first, the old one (<a href="http://www.gw2profits.com/json/forge">http://www.gw2profits.com/json/forge</a>) is still there without any changes. it will only output forge recipes, and only the id and count and ingredients [and name if included]</p>
<p>But I added a v2: <a href="http://gw2profits.com/json/v2/forge">http://gw2profits.com/json/v2/forge</a><br>
this one will always output the name, and also the type and disciplines (as well as id, count, and ingredients). sorry, no more ‘?include=name’, you’ll just have to ignore it if you don’t want it.<br>
type is the type of the item it produces<br>
disciplines is how that recipe is produced.  current disciplines include ‘Mystic Forge’ and ‘Double Click’ and ‘SS Node’.  ‘Mystic Forge’ means that recipe is made in the forge.  ‘Double Click’ means that recipe is made by having ingredients in your inventory and you double click it and it will combine into the output (ex: Mawdrey and Mordrem Lodestone).  ‘SS Node’ is for combining 10 Quartz Crystal into 1 Charge Quartz Crystal at a SP node</p>
<p>also, v2 is searchable:<br>
<a href="http://gw2profits.com/json/v2/forge?output_ids=19698,19699">http://gw2profits.com/json/v2/forge?output_ids=19698,19699</a> returns the recipes that make output_item_id’s 19698 and 19699 (limited to 100 ids)<br>
<a href="http://gw2profits.com/json/v2/forge?names=Platinum">http://gw2profits.com/json/v2/forge?names=Platinum</a> Ore,Mithril Ore returns the recipes that make the items named ‘Platinum Ore’ and ‘Mithril Ore’ (limited to 100 names)<br>
<a href="http://gw2profits.com/json/v2/forge?types=CraftingMaterial">http://gw2profits.com/json/v2/forge?types=CraftingMaterial</a> returns the recipes that make items with type ‘CraftingMaterial’ (there is also ‘Back’, ‘MiniPet’, ‘Greatsword’, ‘Unlock’, ‘Trophy’, etc.) (limited to 100 types)<br>
these can also be combined: <a href="http://gw2profits.com/json/v2/forge?output_ids=19698&names=Orichalcum">http://gw2profits.com/json/v2/forge?output_ids=19698&amp;names=Orichalcum</a> Ore</p>
<p>To make it look pretty, I added an option:<br>
<a href="http://gw2profits.com/json/v2/forge?pretty_print=yes">http://gw2profits.com/json/v2/forge?pretty_print=yes</a><br>
outputs as JSON_PRETTY_PRINT</p>
<p>I also added all the rest of the Mawdrey items (the ‘Double Click’ ones, plus a few forge ones I was missing).  for situations such as Mawdrey and Mawdrey II (where 1 recipe makes 2 outputs), I just made 2 recipes with the 2 different outputs.<br>
I also added the Mordrem and Evergreen ‘Double Click’ promotions</p>
<p>I’m sure I’m missing some ‘Double Click’ recipes, any idea which?  also, there has to be a better word to use in disciplines to describe those and the SS node :P  ideas?</p></p>

<p>uhhhh, what a weird bug.  I’m so sorry, how embarrasing.  no need to fear hitting, I appreciate bug reports, it lets me fix stuff.<br>
it should be fixed now (at least all the items I’ve checked look good)<br>
edit: WAIT!  not fixed yet!<br>
edit2: ok, now it’s fixed</p></p>

<p>uhhhh, I have no idea how that happened (my recipes for most of those were formatted differently).<br>
most are now fixed (except first 2 and last 18 which seem to have a different problem)<br>
Goblet of kings… there are 8 different Bag of Jewels that all seem to be identical (9257-9262,67262,75690: <a href="https://api.guildwars2.com/v2/items?ids=9257,9258,9259,9260,9261,9262,67262,75690">https://api.guildwars2.com/v2/items?ids=9257,9258,9259,9260,9261,9262,67262,75690</a>).  I’ll just go with 9257 for now :P (I think I just left it blank when I first made it)<br>
Charged Quartz Crystal should only have 1 ingredient<br>
llama and Mawdrey stuff should only have 2 ingredients</p></p>

<p>Also – sorry for being annoying – what do you think about adding “salvage” items as well?</p>
<p>An example would be salvaging the new precursors into their crafting items. With that it would be easy generating recipe trees for the precursor crafting<img src="/include/images/smilies/smile.png"></p>
<p>And I quickly made <a href="https://github.com/queicherius/gw2-mystic-forge-recipes">this repo</a>. Basically, it auto-updates from your data to show diffs when stuff changes. Maybe this is a compromise? You could still update via your database and we would have diffs. If it’s a dumb idea I can delete it again no problem, only took a few minutes.</p></p>

<p>I think I’m confused what it does.<br>
how I pictured putting all this on GitHub to go:<br>
copy <a href="http://gw2profits.com/json/v2/forge">http://gw2profits.com/json/v2/forge</a> into text edit, find/replace to make it look pretty, copy into initial GitHub document<br>
after I add a forge recipe, go to <a href="http://gw2profits.com/json/v2/forge?output_ids=(new">http://gw2profits.com/json/v2/forge?output_ids=(new</a> recipes), copy the new ones into text edit, find/replace to make it look pretty, copy into addendumed GitHub document.  I would literally use the page I linked above to get the json output.<br>
“git -pull”? it sounds like it can be set up to just go to that json file and pull any changes that were made.<br>
and I’m not sure how the editor would help. It’s not like a start by writing a json file, then upload it to my own database.  I start by calling the function insert_forge(“Goblet of Kings”,1,“Eldritch Scroll,1,Mystic Coin,30,Bag of Jewels,1,Gold Ingot,250”,‘Mystic Forge’); then it finds the item ids of those items and inserts everything into the recipes database.<br>
I write in Dreamweaver CS5, does that count as an IDE?</p>

<p>OHHHHH, I see what you mean, “Salvage this weapon to receive its spirit, needed to craft the next tier of this legendary precursor.”  I’m not very familiar with precursor crafting, so didn’t know the chain it went through :P<br>
so, like: output: Spirit of The Device x 1, ingredients: The Device x 1 ?<br>
besides precursor crafting, does it happen anywhere else?  is this needed in any other part of precursor crafting besides “prepreprecursor -&gt; spirit of prepreprecursor”?<br>
and do you actually use a basic salvage kit on that prepreprecursor?</p></p>

<p>Yep, that would not work like that (i’d get overwritten). It’s just version tracking. If people wanted to contribute, i’d be the other workflow you described above (with basically copy/pasting the changes you make, but having to merge other people’s changes).</p>

<p>Yep, that’s exactly what I mean. I used a mystic kit on mine, but it didnt really matter. I’d just do it as a new discipline “Salvaging” with the exact output you wrote there.</p>
<p>Not sure if that happens anywhere else… maybe the “Salvage”-Items, like Torn Pelt or something?</p></p>

<p>ohhhh, I hate random outputs.  “The Mystic Forge has a chance to produce an Endless Toymaker’s Tonic, an Endless Gift Dolyak Tonic or the fifth tonic you didn’t use as a material in the process.”<br>
I’m going to make the recipes to make all 3 outputs (5 of each) and give them all a 0.33 output count.</p>
<p>oooo, you can promote snowflakes.  ex: 50 glittering + 1 unique + 5 luminous dust + 3 philo stones = 7-40 unique<br>
anyone know the average amount you get for each tier?</p>
<p>ohhhh, this is a problem.  Spirit of The Bard Experiment isn’t in the api yet (and a few others).  I’m guessing because no one has made it.</p></p>

<p>Thank you so much! This is awesome.<img src="/include/images/smilies/colondee.png"></p>
<p>I changed to be manual, if you tell me your github handle I can change it to you as the owner of the repo (or at least as collaborator, if you dont want the ownership).<img src="/include/images/smilies/smile.png"></p></p>

72083 and 76158… <a href="https://api.guildwars2.com/v2/items?ids=72083,76158">https://api.guildwars2.com/v2/items?ids=72083,76158</a> “all ids provided are invalid” I wonder how the wiki finds them…<br>

<p>ok, so I’ll add items you get from achievements.  some of them will have like 20 ingredients, but I see no reason we can’t do that.  I’ll add the discipline ‘Achievement’ for these.</p>
<p>I’ll also add items you buy from merchants.  some examples: Molten Alliance Fractal Field Research Paper you buy for 28 Fractal Research Page, Gift of Glory you buy for 250 Shard of Glory, Bottle of Elonian Wine you buy for 2504 Copper (25s04c), Gift of Gliding you buy for 300 Airship Part + 300 Lump of Aurillium + 300 Ley Line Crystal.<br>
the challenge/problem is that some of those items are only in the wallet and not an actual item, so we’d have to create those items and decide ids (Copper, karma, laurel, gem, ley line crystal, provisioner token seem to be the only ones without an item).  I’ll add these as the discipline ‘Buy’</p>
<p>I’ll also add the ability to search my api for disciplines.  maybe you only want the forge recipes, or all except Buy, w/e.</p>
<p>let you know when it’s in progress/done!</p></p>

they are mostly items that go into crafting precursors.<br>
still a lot to add, I’ll contine to add more soon</p>
<p>some of the items called for don’t exist in the normal database.  I haven’t finalized the item id list of these, but so far the only ones that are in there are:<br>
1 = Coin (in copper)<br>
20 = Ley Line Crystal</p>
<p>I also added the disciplines argument.<br>

<p>
<p>you know, it’ll be cleaner if we use negative ids for the currencies.<br>
temporary trouble: some of those precursor ingredients I used negative numbers with.  good news is that most of them are now in the database:<br>
Spirit of the Bard Experiment: -1 =&gt; 73117<br>
Astralaria: -4 =&gt; 76158<br>
Gift of Astralaria: -5 =&gt; 71972<br>
Gift of the Cosmos: -6 =&gt; 72083<br>
The Mechanism: -7 =&gt; 71426<br>
Gift of Nevermore: -8 =&gt; 74300<br>
Gift of the Raven Spirit: -9 =&gt; 71173<br>
Nevermore: -10 =&gt; 71383</p>
<p>bad news is not all of them are.  So I decided to change their ids (subtracted 100).  These are the ones that still have negative ids:<br>
Spirit of the Perfected Focus -2 =&gt; -102<br>
Perfected Focus -3 =&gt; -103<br>
Ad Infinitum -11 =&gt; -111<br>
Gift of the Fractals -12 =&gt; -112</p>
<p>and now we’re free to add these item ids:<br>
Coin: -1<br>
Karma: -2<br>
Laurel: -3<br>
Gem: -4<br>
Ascalonian Tear: -5<br>
Shard of Zhaitan: -6<br>
Fractal Relic: -7<br>
Seal of Beetletun: -9<br>
Manifesto of the Moletariate: -10<br>
Deadly Bloom: -11<br>
Symbol of Koda: -12<br>
Flame Legion Charr Carving: -13<br>
Knowledge Crystal: -14<br>
Badge of Honor: -15<br>
Guild Commendation: -16<br>
Transmutation Charge: -18<br>
Airship Part: -19<br>
Ley Line Crystal: -20<br>
Lump of Aurillium: -22<br>
Spirit Shard: -23<br>
Pristine Fractal Relic: -24<br>
Geode: -25<br>
WvW Tournament Claim Ticket: -26<br>
Bandit Crest: -27<br>
Magnetite Shard: -28<br>
Provisioner Token: -29<br>
PvP League Ticket: -30</p>
<p>I’ve already updated all previous recipes that used these ids.</p></p>

<p>I am not sure if giving some recipes the negative currency ids and some the item id is a good idea. From an implementation standpoint I would vote to just use the (negative?) currency ids for all recipes that use them.</p>
<p>Edit: Also, something is going wrong. Did you hard-cap the ingredients to 4? Because e.g. “Expertise in Nightsword Crafting” only has the first 4 ingredients, but on <a href="http://www.gw2profits.com/items.php?search_id=77089">your page</a> it has all of them propperly.</p></p>

<p>ugh.  I don’t like adding a 2nd item for each of those.  but there’s is no good solution here.  ideally, they’d all be legit items imo.  I guess it’s better to keep currencies categorized together.  I’ll edit the last post</p>

<p>fixed!  (yes, json output was only ingredient number 0-3 before)</p>
<p>I’m currently trying to go through the achievement api and convert into achievement recipes… but it seems the reward for completing the achievements isn’t in that api.  do I have to do that part by hand?</p></p>

<p>Wouldn’t that be one of these: <a href="https://api.guildwars2.com/v2/items/39078">one</a>, <a href="https://api.guildwars2.com/v2/items/69862">two</a>? Or is there a third one that’s the real one?</p>

<p>awesome, thanks<img src="/include/images/smilies/smile.png"><br>
at the rate this is going, I might not even be done by the time that’s ready :P<br>
most of the time this takes is deciding which id to use for ‘Gold Fractal Weapon Crate’ (for example), so if the api could just give “reward”: 77263, that would be awesome<img src="/include/images/smilies/colondee.png"><br>
I suppose other people would want the other rewards too, such as titles.  so probably an array of rewards.</p>

<p>yeah, I know those are there.  initially posted them, too :P  then queicherius suggested that we keep all ‘currencies’ the same (ie, use it as a currency instead of a item).  so the negative id notates that it’s a currency instead of an item (and correlates to it’s <a href="https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/API:2/currencies">currency</a> id).<br>
also, the items for most of those aren’t used in-game anymore (from back when dungeon tokens took up bank space).</p>

<p>k, added all of the achievement rewards that are currently available.  some are a bit silly to have here (5 black lion claim ticket for winter weapons), but it was all done via achievement api, so I wanted completeness.<br>
also added some winter recipes (foostivoo, essence of mischief, essence of snowfall, magnanimous obsidian crystal) and snowflake promotion (double click)</p>

<p>some ingredients were changed:<br>
Horologicus (74858)<br>
Fix-r-Upper (69932)<br>
The North Wind (73037)<br>
Wild Abandon (74918)<br>
Ydalir (69817)<br>
Dark Harvest (69893)<br>
Glint’s Bastion (75482)<br>
Bo (69984)<br>
mostly things like Scrapper’s Auric Sharpening Stone -&gt; Herald’s Auric Sharpening Stone</p>
<p>expertise in axe crafting… I think you get this by speaking to a bunch of people.  no items.  <a href="https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Frostfang_II:_The_Perfected_Axe">https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Frostfang_II:_The_Perfected_Axe</a> .  would look silly to have “output: EiAC, ingredients: []”<br>
fixed expertise in sword crafting</p>
<p>there were a bunch I was confused by.  for example, it came up with a recipe for Princess from these item id’s: 69917, 69851, 70062, 70038, 69944, 70002, 69913, 69846, 69905, 69994, 69959, 69824, 69885, 69973, 69952, 69916, 69877, 70022, 69832, 69949, 69914, 70007, 69820, 69941, 70021, 69957, 70037, 69918, 69938, 69940, 69904, 69899, 69859, 69818, 69998, 69868, 69894, 69815, 70016, 69865, 70049, 70015, 70054, 69956, 69833, 69963, 70024, 70050, 69947, 69860<br>
not one of those are actual items, so I assume there are invisible items the game uses to check if you’ve killed a certain karka, for example.<br>
lots of precursor crafting recipes have similar things to this.  I’m just cutting out the ones that aren’t real, which is why this took so long.</p></p>

<p>I added a lot of ‘Buy’ recipes.<br>
basically went through the wiki and copy/pasted from every merchant I could think of.  1,062 of them.<br>
these all use the currency ids I outlined above:<br>
Coin: -1<br>
Karma: -2<br>
Laurel: -3<br>
Gem: -4<br>
Ascalonian Tear: -5<br>
Shard of Zhaitan: -6<br>

Provisioner Token: -29<br>
PvP League Ticket: -30</p>
<p>a lot might be unneeded (there’s like 20 for buying obsidian shards, half are in higher denominations than 1), but I went for completeness instead of what I could possibly think someone might do with it.<br>
I decided to ignore temporary things such as what Charity Corps Seraph is selling.  for geode merchants, I went with only tier 6.  I also tried to avoid conditional things such as the starter kits and achievement rewards from laurel merchants.<br>
also on this list were some Double Click recipes for turning bulk produce into 25 produce (‘use’ “Tomatoes in Bulk” to recieve 25 “Tomatoes”)<br>
there were a few items that weren’t in the api (near as I could tell), such as ‘Recipe: Embellished Intricate Spinel Jewel’. I looked at nearby items to guess their id (in this case, between the topaz and peridot ones). the names are attached to the recipes, so people shouldn’t have too hard a time figuring out what the output id corresponds to.</p>
<p>If you can think of any I missed, let me know.</p>

<p>an idea occurred.  I gave ids to all of these as I made them (negative ids, so they dont conflict with gw2 api recipes).  would that be something good to include in the output?  would also be searchable.  might help for when people only need new ones, for example.  yes/no?</p></p>

<p>It appears several collection unlocks are assigned to Trophies. Some of these are either consumed immediately or don’t actually enter your inventory, but the behind-the-scenes mechanics has them as an account-bound item, briefly placed in your possession just long enough to process the unlock. The Precursor collections have a ton of these; I’ve been posting them on the wiki for the last couple of months to help get those collections docced.</p>

<p>I’m having issues with getting information from your JSON. Going directly to the links gives me the information I’m looking for, but when I try to access it in JavaScript I get an error with it. I’m using a fetch() to get the information, using the same structure as the fetch()‘s I’m using to get info from the GW2API, but it returns a “Failed to fetch” error. I’m not really sure if that’s due to my usage of fetch() or the way your code is hosted, but I was wondering if you could help me try to troubleshoot things? I’ll post relevant code as needed.</p></p>

<p>
<p>:(<br>
the first thing that comes to mind is headers.  originally it JUST outputted the text (not even &lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;…) because whenever I tried to load the page directly into json_decode it returned an error (because it was reading in that html as well).  Then, I think it was queicherius, that told me to use ‘Content-Type: application/json’, and that made it work fantastically, so it has that header now.<br>
I can’t help but wonder about that (because you say it works if you view it, but not if you have code try to get it, which is what I was observing).<br>
I’ll try to help, but I’m not exactly a javascript master :P  what part is it failing at? connecting? downloading the text? decoding the json?  what’s an example url that isn’t working?</p></p>

<p>
<p>As far as I know, it’s an issue with either connecting or receiving — Chrome tells me “Failed to fetch” as an error.</p>
<p>As an example of one of the calls I’m making that works with the GW2 API:<br>
</p><pre><code>fetch("https://api.guildwars2.com/v2/items/" + loadLeg.giftofleg).then(function(response) {
		if(response.ok) {
			response.json().then(function(golJSON) {
				document.getElementById("tier2Title").innerHTML = "&amp;lt;h2&amp;gt;" + golJSON.name + "&amp;lt;/h2&amp;gt;";
				
			});
		} else { // response not okay code in here }
	}).catch(function(error) { // error output for debugging });</code></pre><p></p>
<p>The “document.getElementById…” line is where I’m actually using a value from the JSON I get from the API. However, if I try using your URLs and try to view the information, I get the “Failed to fetch” error from my debugging code. (I know you don’t control the error message, but I wish it were a little more informational :P)</p>
<p><strong>[EDIT]</strong>: Just did some more research on how fetch works, there’s an option to set headers with it so maybe that’s what I’ll need to do<br>
<strong>[EDIT]</strong>: Also just tested in Firefox, the error it gives me is “NetworkError when attempting to fetch resource.” Still not too descriptive but it’s better than Chrome’s output.</p></p>

<p>I’ll have to take a look and see how to use this in my code. I’m still relatively new to the current world of JS (the stuff I learned about 16 years ago really only goes so far :P) and it seems like “fetch()” itself is still experimental so there could be issues lurking just with that.

<p>Nope, I’m still having issues with accessing it in this way. Same errors as before. I wonder if there’s some way to send a specific token to you when I’m pulling information that would enable whatever the correct header response is (similar to how you can use a token to pass a player’s API key in the official API)?</p></p>

<p>
<p>I added some more precursor crafting recipes provided by queicherius<br>
also added Oni Blade, Monkey Lanterns<br>
also added all 1,330 different combinations for making Amalgamated Gemstone. I decided to only include recipes with different ingredients, so excluded recipes where 2 or 3 of the crests/orbs were the same.  main reasoning is that one of the 21 triplet (all 3 ingredients are the same) would ALWAYS be the cheapest. so instead of only have those 21 recipes, I decided to produce recipes that would give you the 3 cheapest ingredients.</p>
<p>I also made that .htaccess Rewrite work.  So bostrees shouldn’t have any more problems (assuming that was the problem).  also, this means it’s less janky<img src="/include/images/smilies/wink.png"><br>
At the same time, I am now on v3, the main difference being searchability.  So you can now do something like <a href="http://gw2profits.com/json/v3?output_id=68063ANDingredient=24514">http://gw2profits.com/json/v3?output_id=68063ANDingredient=24514</a> (recipes that make amalgamated gemstone using Crest of the Shaman) or <a href="http://gw2profits.com/json/v3?name=SunriseORtype=Sword">http://gw2profits.com/json/v3?name=SunriseORtype=Sword</a> (recipes that make Sunrise or any sword)<br>
v3 also outputs the recipe id. good for identifying corrections, or knowing which are newly added. all of these forge recipes are negative, so they won’t conflict with normal recipes.  this recipe id is also searchable: <a href="http://gw2profits.com/json/v3?id=-4205">http://gw2profits.com/json/v3?id=-4205</a><br>
all the info for using it is located at:<br>
<a href="http://gw2profits.com/json">http://gw2profits.com/json</a></p>
<p>april 21 update:<br>
added merchant recipes for all the basic guild decorations<br>
fixed the recipe for Proof: Finite Result (outputted prototype fractal capacitor instead of had it as an ingredient)<br>
deleted old recipes for amalgamated gemstone. some were duplicates, and there were more than there should of been. I’d rather not look through all 1330 of them to find which were the weird ones, so I just deleted them and remade the 1140 that should be there.<br>
added 1140 new 10x Amalgamated Gemstone recipes<br>
added ‘nameslike’ as an argument. similar to ‘names’ except it searches for text included in the item’s name and not just exact matches (you can search for ‘log’ and get all the ‘Green Wood Log’, ‘Soft Wood Log’, etc.)</p>
<p>april 24 update:<br>
added a bunch of achievement recipes<br>
updated a couple old recipes (Gift of the Catalyst, Gift of the Cosmos, Gift of the Raven Spirit, Machined Rifle, a few more)<br>
replaced ingredient id -112 with 37070 (Gift of the Fractals → Gift of Ascension)<br>
added ingredient id -113 = Tiger<br>
added ingredient id -114 = Gift of the Family<br>
added recipes to craft Chuka and Champawat.  There are a lot of achievement recipes for this, and not a lot of items currently exist for them.  Just a warning that the recipes are there but no items.</p></p>

<p>There are other salvage recipes.  a bunch for precursor crafting, and flawless snowflake -&gt; 32 tiny snowflake.<br>
in general, I’ve tried to keep recipes for more guaranteed returns.  1 flawless salvages into 32 tiny, 100% of the time.  however, there are random ones (such as amalgamated gemstone forge recipes, which gives 10-25, average 11.5).<br>
I’ve thought of adding dye salvaging as well.  I think those have the same argument as salvaging ecto into dust.<br>
this wouldn’t result in “but where would it end? salvage material? blue weapons?”, because dye and ecto salvages into exactly 1 thing, while others salvage into multiple choices.<br>
what do you think? should I add recipes for salvaged these?</p></p>

<p>Hi Mystic,</p>
<p>I’m going through your JSON file and comparing it with whats on the wiki at the moment.</p>
<p>I’ve come across these IDs: 66449, 66450, 66451, 66452, 66453 (which are “Recipe: Feast of Black Pepper Cactus Salad”, “Recipe: Feast of Cactus Fruit Salad”, “Recipe: Feast of Nopalitos Saute”, “Recipe: Feast of Roasted Cactus”, “Recipe: Pot of Sweet and Spicy Beans” respectively).</p>
<p>I just went ingame and tried to create the “Recipe: Feast of Black Pepper Cactus Salad”, and strangely the “Bowl of Cactus Fruit Salad” doesn’t appear in the mystic forge UI at all (i.e. it isn’t used in any recipes) – I assume the same is true for the other 4 recipes. Based on this i think these 5x recipes are incorrect.</p>
<p>What’s the source on the information for those recipes?</p></p>

<p>
<p>TLDR: wrote a program that educatedly guessed<br>
for all the “Recipe: Feast/Pot/Giant/Box/Satchel” recipes, I wrote a script that first retrieved all the recipe sheets, then analyzed the end of it’s name and searched for items it thought they might be made from (“Recipe: Feast of <ins>Truffle Steak Dinner</ins>” is made with “Plate of <ins>Truffle Steak Dinner</ins>”).  It then printed the entire association, I read through it to see if it made sense, found the ones with no found items, found them manually.  Then I did some tests with a few and found that each level has it’s own amount of wine, crystal, and coin.  Re-ran the list, this time adding in how much of the other mats were needed, and created the forge recipes that make those recipes.  I then tested and confirmed a lot of them (I wanted to know all of them, so I buy-ordered any available and made the rest.  while making them, I confirmed that those were correct, and none weren’t.  But to make ALL of them would of required something like 9,000 spirit points and I only had like 1100, so I hired guildies to help with the rest, but I couldn’t expect them to also confirm the recipes, so I just gave them the starting items, coin, and wine and said to forge all.  They didn’t give any items back, so I assumed all went well.)</p>
<p>looks like those are only from random drops, so I’ll just remove the recipes.  sorry for the wrong info.</p></p>

<p>No worries, it’s a nice resource to have. I thought I’d do a bit of checking before I updated the wiki with the missing recipes.</p>
<p>Unfortunately I’ve found several recipes with incorrect combinations: I’ve created a list of the recipes that need to be updated. With all fairness to your program it’s taken me all morning to match them properly and check the recipe pages on the wiki are pointing at the right recipe pages – mystic recipes are a complete pain in the butt. (Basically I went ingame and checked that a level 35 item going into the recipe produces a box recipe for a level 35 set). I’ve crawled through the data and matched up the boxes with the level of the input items.</p>
<p>Link to data: (sorry but I just pasted it out of excel..)<br>
<a href="http://pastebin.com/raw/Cwn2NRk9">http://pastebin.com/raw/Cwn2NRk9</a></p>
<p>edit2: Also there are some more Dry Top items (seriously Buried Locked Chests + Dry Top in general are the bane of all recipes) in the armor list: [43801,43802,43803,49738,49739,49740,66433,66436,66470] – i haven’t crafted any of the chestpieces to confirm this yet but i believe these will be from the buried treasure only.</p></p>

<p>I’ve always found that comparing crafting rating is easier than item level, but maybe that’s why the levels are off :P<br>
an example of how annoying these box recipes get: there are 3 “Recipe: Box of Berserker’s Barbaric Armor” (fine, master, and rare).  but there are only 2 “Berserker’s Barbaric Coat” (fine and master).  so I found a rare Berserker’s Gladiator Chestplate that wasn’t part of the “Recipe: Box of Berserker’s Gladiator Armor” to use instead.<br>
then there’s <a href="https://api.guildwars2.com/v2/items/9801">this little bundle of joy</a></p>
<p>I’ll go through that data and make corrections, thanks.  So that pastebin is a list of recipes that are wrong?  might take a while… have tennis plans today<img src="/include/images/smilies/wink.png"></p></p>

<p>Yep sadly those are ones that need updating since they are highly likely* (I crafted 3 different sheets, and burnt all my mystic coins, so didn’t verify the other 45) incorrect.</p>
<p>Barbaric ends up making Gladiators doesn’kitten Also lol the pot of recipes, I did a doubletake when I saw that yesterday. Submitted a bug report ingame for good measure too.<img src="/include/images/smilies/smile.png"></p></p>

<p>
<p>oh god this is horrible!  I untangled some of it… let me example:<br>
39448 Recipe: Box of Giver’s Gladiator Armor (275) exotic<br>
gives 39412 Box of Giver’s Gladiator Armor (275) 65 exotic<br>
requires 38190 Giver’s Gladiator Chestplate (275) 65 rare</p>
<p>39447 Recipe: Box of Giver’s Splint Armor (200) rare<br>
gives 39411 Box of Giver’s Splint Armor (200) 50 rare<br>
requires 38191 Giver’s Splint Coat (200) 50 masterwork</p>
<p>the motherkitten rarities don’t match!  at least the required materials do, but can’t compare item id’s in-game<br>
well, that solves the first 2 out of 47 recipes :P<br>
I’ll work on the rest now</p>
<p>edit: looks like the rest are just swapped and not a series of items<br>
edit: k, done.  I also deleted the celestial and nomad box recipes you mentioned.  next, I’ll try to error-check all of them by comparing the materials used to make the coat vs. the box.  There was one on your list that was accurate as it was: -940.</p></p>
