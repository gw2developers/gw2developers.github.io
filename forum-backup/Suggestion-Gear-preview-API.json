Right now I can preview most things from Wardrobe, but I have to look up dyes on TP and preview from there – it’s just cumbersome.  This would be a really cool API though, or even a stand-alone web app on the GW2 website: let you do character creation, armor/weapon choice, dyes, etc. to play with the character look.  Basically I get bored at work and this would make my life complete.</p>\n<p>Cheers!</p>","arenanet":false}]}
