<p>
<p>Hello everybody,</p>
<p>I’m using the api to create the statistics of your sales and purchases (total sales, total fees, total cost, income statement). <br>
If you wanna try it, please log in to: <br>
<a href="https://www.gw2bltc.com/account">https://www.gw2bltc.com/account</a></p>
<p>I’d really appreciate any kind of feedback!</p></p>

<p>
<p>At first glance this looks really nice!<br>
I was very interested in my tax report, a pity that the API only tracks transactions for 90 days<img src="/include/images/smilies/sad.png"></p>
<p>Anyways, I appreciate your work, if there is an item in the gem store you would like as a gift, please let me know.</p>
<p>Here my tax report of the last 3 months from my trading account.</p></p>

<p>
<p>Oh, as you can see in my screenshot, the values for listing fees and sales tax under sell offers are mixed up, it should be the other way around.</p></p>

<p>Hello Champion Trader!<br>
You are correct! My mistake, this will be corrected in the next update.</p>
<p>If it’s not too much, I’d like to have the balthazar’s outfit or the dragon mask skin.<br>
Thank you for your generosity!</p></p>

<p>I sent you the outfit, so you finally look meta now. I only still wear it to show off the extra black smoke effect from cat´s shadow. <br>
Some more feedback:</p>
<p>The flipping section of the overview is the most interesting to me, apart from the amount of taxes i paid and the overall value of my listings.<br>
It would be nice to see your profit percentage on flipping in the overview, so basically<br>
(total profit/total cost)*100</p>
<p>Also, if you go into the specific overview of your flips, history or current listings, it would be nice to have more filter options, basically the ones you also have on the regular tp ui.<br>
That would enable me to check how much of a certain item or item group i flipped.</p></p>

<p>
<p>A decent start, but there are a lot of features that jump out at me as missing.</p>
<p>Always mention the date range covered.</p>
<p>Sort on any column.</p>
<p>Collapse mulitple listings of same item into one. I’ve sold many a fair amount of hard wood logs. Instead of listing the piecemeal they really sold as, give me option to collapse it all into one line, with total qty, and average price.</p>
<p>Sort/Collapse by type. “How much have I made selling rare sigils?” “How much of my TP income comes from raw materials sells? rare materials?”</p>
<p>Graph over time of total income, outgo, taxes.</p>
<p>On ‘Home’ screen, Income Statement seems to be complete repeat of Sold History and Bought History sections.</p></p>

<p>
<p>Thanks for your comments! <br>
I will add sort order and filter options in the future. But for now, I have done the following:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Account page is updated every 5 minutes.</li>
	<li>History: Report of sales/purchases by item.</li>
	<li>Sell/Buy orders: You’ll receive an alert(sound) letting you know that you have been outbid/undercut  (You’ll need to keep the sell/buy tab open, but you can keep it up as a tab in the background).</li>
</ul>

I hope you like the new features!</p>
<p>Cheers.</p>
<p>PD: Thank you so much for the amazing outfit!</p></p>
