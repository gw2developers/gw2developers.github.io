If someone is able to hack in to your account he will do it with or without API keys. You are worried if showing your account info can make you a target? If you are extremely rich than you can be a target but you must be aware that its not easy to hack such accounts. Stupid and naive ppl are real targets for hackers.</p>","arenanet":false},{"pubDate":"2016-10-03T09:27:02.000Z","guid":"http://forum-en.guildwars2.com/forum/community/api/New-Application-GW2-Sidekick/6349500","author":"Elfo Bianco.3786","body":"\n<blockquote><div class=\"citey\"><cite title=\"Posted on October 02 2016 04:18PM\"><a href=\"/forum/community/api/New-Application-GW2-Sidekick/6348754\">Xiler.7368:</a></cite></div><div class=\"quotey\"><p>Sorry to be a worrier, but is this safe ?

So never write them even if asked somewhere, and never use the same email for apps and game.</p>\n<p>p.s. The only thing you can be worried about is that some apps could store data retrieved from API. It is always safe, but maybe someone doesn’t even like to give personal account data for statistics only.</p>","arenanet":false},{"pubDate":"2016-10-02T16:18:48.000Z","guid":"http://forum-en.guildwars2.com/forum/community/api/New-Application-GW2-Sidekick/6348754","author":"Xiler.7368","body":"\n<p>Sorry to be a worrier, but is this safe ?
