No APIs etc.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.matthewstudios.gw2legendary\">this is the app</a></p>\n<p>I’ve never worked with APIs before and I decided to give it a try, but the problem is I have no idea where to start. For example, I want to implement an API in my app that will connect to TP prices and show live prices for each of these legendary weapons. The main reason I want to do this is to learn how to work with APIs, to get the concept of it. Once I get “used” to it, I’ll implement a lot more API features<img src=\"/include/images/smilies/smile.png\"></p>\n<p>So basically what I’m asking for:<br>\n- Some tips on where to start working with APIs, how to implement GW2 APIs in eclipse etc.<br>\n- Any kind of pointers that would help me a lot as a newbie<img src=\"/include/images/smilies/smile.png\"></p>\n<p>Thanks for answers in advance!</p>","arenanet":false}]}
