<p>Hi API developers!</p>
<p>I wanted to share with you an exciting news that may interest you: we just launched the Overwolf Guild Wars 2 App Challenge. You can read all about this on the App Challenge page here: <a href="http://bit.ly/1MAayy8">http://bit.ly/1MAayy8</a></p>
<p>This thread is also the opportunity for you to ask us questions about the contest, exchange ideas, tips and tricks. You can suggest app ideas on this page: <a href="http://feedback.overwolf.com/forums/283727-guild-wars-2-challenge-ideas">http://feedback.overwolf.com/forums/283727-guild-wars-2-challenge-ideas</a></p>
<p>We hope you’ll consider participating and, if you do, wish you luck<img src="/include/images/smilies/carethappy.png"></p></p>

<p>I’m kind of confused. I read the API calls available, and it doesn’t seem like there is any way to get information about the local instance of the game or the user that is running the [overwolf] app. Which would seem important to have, being a HUD-based program.</p>
<p>For example, for the WvW apps one can gather the map info and graphics, but there is no way to know which map the user is at. They have to select it manually.</p>
<p>Am I misunderstanding this limitation?</p></p>

<p>Stephanie, like Spayced I just heard about Overwolf today from this announcement and thought to myself "oh wow, this sounds fun and perhaps Overwolf will give us some type of access to useful in-game information that we can in-turn build a responsive app from", but found to my disappointment that Overwolf is essentially a glorified overlay tool.  The only information it is able to pull from the actual client is essentially ’window’ information (i.e. height, width, is it min/maxed, running, etc).  Other than just being a tool that can allow one to easily overlay any type of web development, I’m just not sure what the use is here.  I’d love to be able to get some more robust, read-only information like "name of player currently selected", or "weapons currently equipped" etc, which would allow us developers to take that information and use resources like the GW2 API to query against and provide some cool responses/useful information to the client side user to.  Am I missing something with Overwolf?</p></p>

<p>Right. I forgot that the world_id was always broken in WvW, so this value is basically useless now in all cases.</p></div></blockquote>
<p>Aww that sucks, hope they fix it so I can find the world automatically from my Overwolf app.</p></div></blockquote>
<p>But it does seem to reliably provide <em>some</em> good information, like character class and name.</p>
<p>I found a different method on pulling current in-game info:<br>
<a href="http://www.gw2hud.com/">http://www.gw2hud.com/</a></p>
<p>Apparently the game provides detailed information for high-end keyboards, and if you write software which pretends to be one, you can tap into it. I’ll need to do more research to see if it is compatible with the whole overwolf concept.</p></p>

<p>Im happy to see you start such an awesome initiative, but could we, for the mac client, have something for us too? at least push over wolf team to build a compatible app?  Or more important , some of the featured apps for over wolf should and can be implemented directly on the gw2 client , i fear that the second of nice feature like boss timer are available from over wolf , we poor users of the mac (beta) client will never see it implemented in to the game for us too. <br>
in the end , I’m positive on this kind of initiative , but really hope that some of the basic feature could be implemented for all the player base and not just half of it, I’m i wrong?<br>
sorry if bothered someone , not in my intention :P</p></p>

<p>Hi docMed, Stéphane (not Stéphanie<img src="/include/images/smilies/wink.png"> here! Overwolf is offering you an SDK to develop things on top of Guild Wars 2, while the Guild Wars 2 API will offer you mean to create content that’s relevant to the game. Some of the information you mention maybe something that’s more relevant to the newly-released <a href="/forum-backup/Launching-v2-account-w-Authentication">Authenticated APIs</a> ? Take a look at previous contests and <a href="http://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Overwolf">Overwolf GW2 apps</a> for ideas about how some developers have made this work (note that not all apps use the GW2 API).</p>

<p>Hey there!</p>
<p>Name’s Raif, I’m the Overwolf Community Manager.  Overwolf already has <a href="http://www.overwolf.com/apps/tsgw2_contest/#!appId=eleipbaclaggfgaebdmdieecjmjpphmnocjndibp">world boss timers</a> and <a href="http://www.overwolf.com/apps/tsgw2_contest/#!appId=gbakibjneaoiiabnbibbgmnkgleiibpfmeglmcbg">WvW camp timers</a> and such created by developers from past contests which you can see on the Appstore.</p>
<p>As much as we’d love to have a Mac client it’s not something we have planned for the near future. A lot of the tech needed to do what Overwolf does would have to be re-written and it would take a very very long time to do that even if we were to start today. Having a Mac client is something we want to do eventually, but it’s not in the cards at this time.</p></p>

<p>Hey everyone,</p>
<p>Just thought I’d mention that OVerwolf is giving away 20 Plantronics RIG headset to the first 20 developers to submit a qualifying app (*). Feel free to interact in this thread, with Raif or directly on the <a href="http://forums.overwolf.com/index.php?/forum/23-app-development/">Overwolf developer forum</a></p>
<p>Happy coding<img src="/include/images/smilies/carethappy.png"><br>
Thanks!</p>
<p>(*) To maintain a high level of quality, Overwolf and ArenaNet reserve the right to choose which apps qualify to the Overwolf Appstore. You can still update the app after the first upload. All original Contest rules apply, winning the giveaway does not affect your changes to win the challenge.</p></p>

<p>
<p>Let me see if I understood this correctly. Someone could submit an APP now even if it’s nowhere near finished, get the RIG headset and then keep working on the APP for 59 more days to make it awesome and update it before the contest ends?</p>
<p>And in that case, the previously submitted APP version wouldn’t matter at all to make the final decission since it would be only taken as valid the last update? Or would it change anything and would be an stupid idea to submit a half-developed APP before the contest ends?</p>
<p>On top of that questions, there’s the fear that others could steal other programmer’s ideas and develop a better version of your APP in less time due to programming skills (As example, i’m learning javascript and CSS coding while programming. For me to create an APP it’s more time consuming and someone with the same idea could do it faster/better).</p>
<p>We need some clarification, Stephane<img src="/include/images/smilies/colondee.png"></p></p>

<p>Yes, you can do exactly that. You aren’t guaranteed to win that headset because it has to be of a certain level of quality, but yes you can create a basic app now, send it in to win the headset and then update it as the contest goes on.</p>

<p>The final judgement of your app will be on your <strong>final app only</strong>. Whatever you submit now for the headset will not count towards your final submissions judgement.</p>

<p>There should be no fear of someone stealing your idea as no one but Overwolf and AreneNet will see your app unless you share it.</p>

<p>Might I please ask that you release the apps someplace where they are universally available and not just on your social media, as indicated in your press release?</p>
<p>I am very interested in almost all of them, including wondering what “Jump!” might do to help me with the jumping on puzzles.  As it is, my thumb hurts constantly from hitting the space bar, generally while doing jumping puzzles.  I know I can remap, but then it would just be some other finger.  Anyway, I’m not on any social media, other than Linked In.  Can’t handle their EULAs.</p>
<p>So I am hoping you might be able to accommodate this crowd of admittedly limited numbers who, like me, would be unable to access any of the winning entries, if they are only released on social media.</p></p>
