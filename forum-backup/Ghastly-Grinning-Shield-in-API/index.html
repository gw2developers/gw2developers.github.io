<p>I’m not sure if this is the right place or whether it’d be better suited to the bug forum.</p>
<p>Ever since <a href="https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Ghastly_Grinning_Shield">this item</a> was made available again through the forge though it hasn’t shown up on the TP or API as it should. This item has listings available, but none of the third party tools that track TP items show any correct information about the item, that is its history and its availability/sell listings.</p>
<p>It also does not show on the TP <b>ingame</b> though unless you untick ‘only show available items’ even though there are three listings of the item on the TP, which means this may need to be in the bug forum instead.</p>
<p>It seems like some IDs are messed up or something and that a lot of the third party sites are tracking a previous incarnation of this item.</p>
<p>TP tracking site links from the wiki for this item<br>

<p>The vendor value of item 36332 is 0, which AFAIK makes the item implicitly untradeable. I believe the API is correct (and attempts to purchase it via the TP should fail, regardless of what the UI displays).</p></p>

<p>You <strong>can</strong>purchase and sell it on the TP though. The item was re-released with other halloween weapon versions of skins such as <a href="https://www.gw2tp.com/item/36333-scythe-staff"> Scythe Staff </a>and  <a href="https://www.gw2tp.com/item/36334-greatsaw">Greatsaw </a> and these skins work fine on the TP and on the API; they show up on the TP correctly and their history can be tracked accurately via API.</p>
<p>I feel like either this item has been given the wrong ID or the vendor value wasn’t updated when this item was put back into the game. Either way, its not working like the other halloween weapons despite being tradeable.</p>
<p>This album has a few pictures of the item ingame: <a href="http://imgur.com/a/d47Hr">http://imgur.com/a/d47Hr</a></p>
<p>First pic shows what happens when you search for ghastly shield with ‘only show available ticked’<br>
Second pic shows the same but with ‘only show available’ unticked.<br>
First pic shows that there are shields available, and yes, you can buy/sell.</p>
<p>This probably should be in the bug forum – but it has been bugged for a long time now and I don’t have great hopes posting it there.</p></p>

<p>
<p>Actually, I just noticed that another ‘Ghastly Shield’ has item ID: 39173. Eg. <a href="https://www.gw2tp.com/item/39173-ghastly-grinning-shield">https://www.gw2tp.com/item/39173-ghastly-grinning-shield</a></p>
<p>Is this part of the problem?<br>
edit: seems that’s the old PVP skin?</p></p>

<p>
<p>The Scythe Staff, Greatsaw, Grinning Gourd Rifle all have 0 vendor value as well and the same set of flags as the shield but they return results normally.</p></p>

<p>A comment on the reddit thread I made:</p>
<p>“39173 is the old PvP weapon so that is normal.</p>
<p>You might want to post this on <a href="https://forum-en.guildwars2.com/forum/community/api">https://forum-en.guildwars2.com/forum/community/api</a> since the commerce API returns “no such id” for 36332. That is the reason they don’t down up on the sites you mentioned. According to the API it doesn’t exist."</p></p>

<p>
<p>It looks like whatever causing the problem for the shield is also causing it for the “Awakened” weapons. In the case of the Awakened weapons it is probably intentional since those are supposed to be from PoF but this might be a potential clue.</p></p>

<p>0 value makes it implicitly unsellable to in-game merchants, as does the NoSell tag, but I don’t think it would keep it off of the trade post. To keep it off of the TP it generally has to be account/soulbound.</p></p>
