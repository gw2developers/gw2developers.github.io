For example each item id and amount. <br>\nWanted to make an api that will get that info and record it in some file for further use, like making statistic about how much items on average you get from salvaging particular item and such. I’ve run trough gw2 API documentation but it seams that isnt supported or I am blind.</p>\n<p>If this doesnt work I am thinking of using OCR on specific place on screen, where loot scrolls down above minimap, and trying to process information like that. <br>\nIf I am missing something or if you have any other ideas please let me know.<br>\nThank you.</p>","arenanet":false}]}
