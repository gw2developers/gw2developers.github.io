For example the item ID: 42426 (Sclerite Karka Shell), how can I know that this item doesn’t have any upgrade slots? In that case I can’t consider that all ascended item doesn’t have any upgrade slots, while all the other items yes.</p>\n<p>Second issue: for recipes there is the API:2/recipes that gives all the info about the crafting disciplines required and the minimum rating required to craft the item. For materials there is the API:2/materials, but I don’t find any info about which crafting disciplines can use them and at which rating. I don’t understand if I missing something, I have already seen wiki pages, but nothing yet.</p>","arenanet":false}]}
