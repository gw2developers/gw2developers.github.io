A “vendor” isn’t the NPC, it’s just the window with the items for sale. The main goals for the vendors endpoint were (1) to expose item pricing and (2) to expose rotating/daily vendor sales. There might be room in the future to provide a list of NPCs on each map (or in each sector) but that’s a much more difficult proposition (since a lot of NPCs are spawned via map scripts and so forth).</p>","arenanet":true},{"pubDate":"2017-06-11T06:33:34.000Z","guid":"http://forum-en.guildwars2.com/forum/community/api/How-to-get-area-and-merchant-names/6615322","author":"xanthic.9478","body":"\n<p>From what I am able to find in the current v2 api I can get:<br>\ncontinent -&gt; region -&gt; map name(In api supported languages)</p>\n<p>I would like to be able to go one further to area names, such as <br>\nTyria -&gt; Shiverpeak Mountains -&gt; Snowden Drifts -&gt; Dragon’s Rising (In API supported languages)</p>\n<p>Additionally I would like a list of all merchants(vendors) that could be retrieved with the lang flag for localization.
