Thank you for the suggestion.</p></div></blockquote>\n<p>This is precisely what we need—to be able to remotely query for the current guild roster table—and here is a use-case: <a href=\"https://drupal.org/sandbox/Sborsody/1999472\">Drupal 7 implementation of GW2 API</a>.</p>\n<p>In that case, what we would like to do is have our web server periodically (perhaps hourly on cron) query for changes in the guild roster, to keep a website user database up-to-date. This relieves a major pain-point for managing third-party guild websites. When a guild operates a website (say a forum) which has some permissions configured which require knowledge of the simple fact of whether or not a website-account owner is a member of this guild in-game, then this API proposal will make that significantly easier.</p>\n<p>The root problem we want to address is that our third-party systems support contains data that always grows stale quickly. We absolutely must keep third-party copies of our guild rosters, and often the ranks as well. Currently, we are being forced to do this manually in all cases.</p>\n<p>This API suggestion would truly be a major step toward helping player-organized communities grow up around your game. The hurdles we have to jump through currently are prohibitive. We have no clean and trustworthy access to any of the user- or guild-related data, and we’re forced to spend man-hours doing free data entry to compensate. Most of us refuse to do that, and our communities suffer.</p>\n<p>We do not require write access, you can keep that in the game client. We do need read access, and it can be put behind OAuth2. I propose that a separate OAuth2 token should be generated for each guild, and it should be revealed only to the guild leader(s). This would be an API access token in the same respect as <a href=\"https://developers.google.com/accounts/docs/OAuth2\">implemented in Google API</a>, but with read-only access. The data made available there should be the same as we see in the guild screen in-game. The order in which you choose to implement these is yours to make, but I could likely give you a solid case for read-access to most pieces of it.</p>\n<p>The roster is the most important data for us. The full roster and achievement points (including exact time that the most recent points were earned) are <a href=\"https://leaderboards.guildwars2.com/en/na/achievements/guild/\">already public to every guild member, on the web</a>, and the rest of data is public to them in-game. We just want it in a machine-readable format, up front, through the API, without having to parse DOM on that page.</p>\n<p>Some examples of using the other data for community-building and support purposes:</p>\n<ul>\n\t<li>Query influence point history to plot on a graph when the guild is most actively playing.</li>\n\t<li>Query influence point history to calculate an estimate of upgrade capabilities (how often can we activate a planned set of Boost upgrades).</li>\n\t<li>Query upgrades building status to generate an alert message on some condition like no upgrade running.</li>\n\t<li>Query Message of the Day to publish it in other systems, like a website.</li>\n\t<li>Query histories like Upgrades, Missions, Roster to know who is accomplishing all of that work, over a longer period than the 1 to 2 weeks shown in-game.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>However, my favorite and most desired one would be read-access to the ranks and the roster (with user rank included) so that we can use the rank system in-game, to affect ACLs outside of the game. I don’t mean the in-game permissions assignments here, just simply the rank naming and positioning of the ranks within the list of 10 possible ranks. It would be fairly straight-forward for us to create 1:1 relationships between ranks in-game and, for example, account roles in Drupal or channel/server groupings in TeamSpeak.</p>\n<p>Also note that there is discussion of <a href=\"https://forum-en.guildwars2.com/forum/community/api/GW2-s-Mumble-Link-context-data-format\">this solution’s pain-point here</a>, where some thought to use the Mumble memory-mapped file as a temporary unsecured solution.</p>","arenanet":false},{"pubDate":"2013-09-26T22:18:16.000Z","guid":"http://forum-en.guildwars2.com/forum/community/api/API-Suggestion-Guilds/2920299","author":"Heimdall.4510","body":"\n<blockquote><div class=\"citey\"><cite>rodadams.5963</cite></div><div class=\"quotey\"><p>I’d actually prefer a slightly different approach.</p>\n<p>Be able to generate any number of keys, each with a different set of permissions, perhaps, and then be able to deactivate them individually.</p>\n<p>That way, you could experiment with site XYZ, decide you don’t trust them, and cut them off without interfering with your guild site (or whatever).</p></div></blockquote>\n<p>all in all this is a rly good idea but why do you want to generate multiple keys?

The flip side of that is that login requirements would made for guild members. A lot of people do not like this mostly a lot of GW1 players did not like to see it re-appear in GW2 and there is little need as there is a high guild cap.
