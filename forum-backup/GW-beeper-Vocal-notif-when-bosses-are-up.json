I have no idea if what i’ve coded will work well if lots of peep are using the page, but lets see …</p>\n<p>Currently ongoing addon will be  :<br>\n- Clean review of all events to add missing ones and remove some useless ones<br>\n- Add language support (currently only english voices are generated)<br>\n- Identified bugs fixing (various server error)<br>\n- Improve that ugly minimalist interface<br>\n- Add smarter logs (currently DEV-like)<br>\n- Add filter options (world boss, temples …)</p>\n<p>I barely tested it under Win7 + IE,firefox,chrome, Linux, Android.
