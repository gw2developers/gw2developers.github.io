Please have a look at the <a href=\"https://github.com/oliverschwarz/gw2api\">github project</a>.</p>\n<p>The API client contains a simple filesystem cache (for saving bandwidth and resources) and a small test to display the clientâ€™s capabilities.</p>\n<p>Due to limited time I am not sure if I am able to keep on developing (I even play GW2 very rarely now), but feel free to fork the project and make it your own. Of course, I will try to answer any questions that may occur.</p>\n<p>Have fun and thanks, ArenaNet, for this beautiful open API.</p>","arenanet":false}]}
