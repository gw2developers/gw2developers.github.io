Would it be within the realm of possibility – not necessarily now – to add in an “active:” endpoint as well to the character output to accomplish what we’re looking to do? If the api holder is not logged in, or logged in as invisible, it could have the “active:” value set to 0 (or blank), and if they’re logged in under a character, it should set the flag for that character to 1. I believe, if anything, that having an “active:” endpoint would be a welcome addition to “age:” because of these reasons.</p>\n<p>Thanks for all the support and interactions with the community on these discussions.</p>","arenanet":false}]}
