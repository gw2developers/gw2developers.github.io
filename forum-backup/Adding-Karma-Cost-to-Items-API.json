Tons of people notice the birthday scrolls. Less talked about are the identically named champion bags, e.g. the wiki identifies over a dozen <em>exotic</em> versions of the <a href=\"http://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Fallen_Adventurer%27s_Backpack\">Fallen Adventurer’s Backpack</a> (plus non-exotic varieties as well). It seems that they should have different names, if they point to different loot tables, or have the same item ID if they use the same tables.</p>\n<p>There are similar examples for found gear versus vendor gear versus karma gear: same item name and different IDs, since each have different values of salvageable, tradeable, and salable.</p>","arenanet":false},{"pubDate":"2015-08-04T17:30:42.000Z","guid":"http://forum-en.guildwars2.com/forum/community/api/Adding-Karma-Cost-to-Items-API/5348228","author":"Lawton Campbell.8517","body":"\n<p>I’m not sure why, but for a lot of items there appear to be duplicate item definitions?
