The reason being that the ingredients in a recipe is also exposed as a JSON array and since my code needs to calculate the minimum crafting cost of a recipe, I would convert the ingredients array to be an array of recipes recursively.  It makes sense to work with a JSON array of recipes with a JSON array of recipes within each recipe element as ingredients.</p>\n<p>Another reason is that gw2db also exposes its items and recipes as a JSON array.  Putting ArenaNet’s data in a JSON array this way makes it easier for developers to transition their code from one JSON database into the other.</p>\n<p>That said, it may seem better, at first, to expose them as JSON objects with their recipe_id/item_id as keys so we can deserialize them into a dictionary for a faster lookup.  But since the ids are almost in running order, it probably wouldn’t matter much if they are deserialized into an array and we use the normalized ids as array indices.</p>","arenanet":false},{"pubDate":"2013-05-28T06:56:26.000Z","guid":"http://forum-en.guildwars2.com/forum/community/api/Data-dump-All-recipes-and-created-items/2103461","author":"zwei.9073","body":"\n<p>Cheers and thanks!</p>\n<p>It is bit different format thou (JSON array, versus JSON object with id-keys) – could we agree of dump format?
