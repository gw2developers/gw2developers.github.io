<p>
<p>Within the coming weeks, we’re deprecating our OAuth2 authentication mechanism and replacing it with an API key system. While this means that authentication is no longer a supported use-case, the change should make client implementation a bit easier — instead of registering an app and going through the OAuth2 code flow, users simply create and copy-paste an API key into your client.</p>
<p>Our current timeline for rolling out these changes is as follows:</p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Thursday, May 7th</strong>: API keys will be turned on, and new OAuth2 client registration will be disabled. Existing OAuth2 clients will continue to work, but the management interface will not be accessible.</li>
	<li><strong>Thursday, June 4th</strong>: All OAuth2 clients will be disabled. Only API keys will be usable for authenticated requests.</li>
</ul>
<p>API keys effectively in the same manner as OAuth2 access tokens: to use them, you pass them via the ‘Authorization’ header, e.g.</p>
<pre><code>    GET /v2/account HTTP/1.1
    Host: api.guildwars2.com
    Authorization: Bearer EA9F0026-FEEF-9046-840B-30E8EC68B4FE5A0585DA-333B-454A-9C1F-6A548AB2D690

</code></pre>
<p>API keys do not expire until the user explicitly deletes them via the management interface. Each key has an immutable user-defined list of scopes; we’re adding an endpoint to fetch the list of scopes the key was granted.</p>
<p>Let me know if you have any questions/concerns and I’ll do my best to address them.</p></p>

<p>I doubt that this would make anything better for the users. There are a lot of people out there who hardly know to start a pc and run their game – imagine these to create and use an API key.  Despite of it’s flaws, OAuth2 is being used all over the web for way more sensitive applications and most users are used to it. I mean, we’re talking about an API account which reveals little sensitive data, not actual user account info (e.g. real names, address, billing info).<br>
So the only thing you might mitigate is that a user gets their login data scammed (which also happens in so many different ways) at the cost of making the login flow less user friendly. You cannot mitigate <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_error">PEBCAK</a>.</p></p>

<p>It’s pretty straightforward — there’s an interface on the account site for the user to create API keys, then they copy-paste them into the application. From there, the API keys work the same way that OAuth2 access tokens do now (e.g., you just stick them in an Authorization header in the API request).</p>
<p>I’ll write up a thing on Github Monday and poke poke to get docs on the wiki.</p>

<p>I don’t disagree. It is what it is. At the very least, this will make it more difficult since the expected flow doesn’t involve redirection from a third-party site to a login page.</p></p>

<p>I highly agree with smiley.</p>
<p>I still need to redirect my users to the official site. (Letting them create an API key.) The only relevant thing that changed is that there is no pingpack from official site and the rdirect is not officially included but necessary.</p>
<p>However i don’t think that it was a decision made by the programmer team. I think it’s better than nothing and i can deal with it …</p></p>

<p>So do I understand right that the use of the Google Authenticator app is being stopped? Something else is going to be put in its place, but a decent guideline and description of where to do it would be nice, rather than me having to scour the internet for information.</p>
<p>Also a LOT of people do not read the forums. And definitely not the API development section. How are all those people going to be informed of this massive change?</p></p>

<p>I do disagree with the part about redirecting from a 3rd party site</p>
<p>The only user that will type in GuildWars2.com in their browsers, go to their account page manually and then create an API key instead of just pressing a button on the 3rd party site, are the users who are aware of phishing who wouldn’t fall for the OAuth phishing attempt either (because it is exactly the same)</p>
<p>A normal user will just press a button on the 3rd party site, leaving them just as vulnerable to phishing as before (it is the same).</p>
<p>We are also assuming that the sites that do want to steal account information do not just put in a button saying, “click here to ….” what ever that site might need and not a text saying “go to GuildWars2.com to retrieve your API key, see this tutorial for help on how to do it”</p>
<p>I fail to see how this new system changes any of the attack vectors</p></p>

<p>
<p>I’m going to jump in and say I agree with the others. This will do nothing to mitigate phishing, as most people will still link to the page. It will only serve as more of a hassle to the users for having to do extra steps, and developers who will have to provide extra support because this will confuse a lot of people.<br>
This decision feels like it was made by some manager who read about oauth phishing on some business site, and decided he needed to do something to continue seeming relevant, even if he had no idea what he was talking about.</p></p>

<p>Hello, you have found the API development forum! This forum is intended for software developers who want to incorporate data from Guild Wars 2 into their applications. The content in this forum is not intended for the “common folk” who play the game.</p>

<p>Nope, this is completely unrelated to the two-factor authentication system for logging into the game. This post is about a method that users can leverage to provide a limited amount of account information to third-party apps, such as an Android app developed by a Guild Wars 2 fan.</p></p>

<p>If I’m reading this right, it sounds like authentication on mobile devices is going to be enough of a pain in the kitten  that no GW2 mobile apps will have a smooth authentication path. If authentication is no longer a supported use-case, I’m struggling to see what use-cases are left where API keys tied to specific users are involved.</p>
<p>I’m not sure what the blocking issue is. I wonder if provisional keys might not be a good compromise – hand out initially non-working keys via the API that have to be approved by the user while securely logged in.</p></p>

<p>To echo Tanis, this change has absolutely nothing to do with the game. Normal players will not be affected at all. This forum is for people who develop applications (e.g., gw2spidy, gw2shinies, gw2tp, etc). The change will affect how application developers retrieve data from the GW2 servers.</p>
<p>The authenticator app is not going away. Nothing is changing that really affects players.</p>

<p>Yeah, the flow for web-based mobile apps is not going to be very clean, UX-wise. I’m probably going to put QR codes on the API key management page so that native apps can “copy-paste” the key into the application in a gross but somewhat feasible manner.</p>

<p>Provisional keys would have worked too; they have the benefit of allowing the application to request specific permissions. I do think that approach involves more complexity and has an even worse mobile story, though.</p></p>

<p>
<p>Previously we had a link “Click here to login with your Guild Wars 2 account”, now we have “Click here to login to your Guild Wars 2 account, create an API key with the permissions X, Y and Z and then come back here, paste it into that input and in case you did something wrong, do it all over again”.</p>
<p>It is only harder for the user, and every malicious site/app can still link to a fake login screen. I really don’t see how that is supposed to help with phishing. (Except for a few users saving their API keys in a password manager. But those few responsible users would probably want to generate new keys with specific permissions for every app, so they’d need to reauthenticate anyway. And they would probably not fall for phishing in the first place.)</p>
<hr>
<p>TL;DR of the remaining post: Users are lazy, UX is horrible, doesn’t fix the phishing problem, OAuth was better for everyone.</p>
<p>OAuth was easy to implement (with thousands of tested libraries available for all languages/frameworks) and had great UX for users. API keys are horrible UX-wise. There are just so many scenarios that just don’t work well with API keys.</p>
<p>1.) Most Users will just generate 1 key with full permissions and reuse it for all apps. Once they want to revoke access to their account from one app (and the app doesn’t provide an easy way of doing that in the app/the user doesn’t trust the app to completely remove the key), the users has to generate a new key and reenter it in all other apps he uses. (There could be quite a few “passive” apps he doesn’t often visit and only notices the errors months after).</p>
<p>2.) An app requires the permissions X, Y and Z, but the users forgets that by the time he has logged in to the account page (can take quite some time: 2 factor, email for unknown IP, looking up password in password manager/phone/notebook, …) and only allows access to X and Y. Now the users has to do all that again after entering the API key in the app and getting an error. Maybe he was using private browsing and has to do the login to his account page all over again.</p>
<p>3.) An app requires new permissions after an update, the user now has to create a new key and enter it again, maybe even for multiple apps that required the same permissions before and he was sharing the key for.</p>
<p>4.) You create a new scope for the API, the user now also has to update all apps in case he only uses one key for all apps. And no matter how much we tell the users to generate new keys with specific permissions for each app, most users won’t do that because they are lazy and don’t see the problems of it in the future.</p>
<p>5.) Probably way more than that, those were just a few off the top of my head, but we will run into more problems once we are using them…</p>
<p>OAuth had easy solutions for most of these problems by simply doing most of it behind the scenes, leaving the user no way to mess up. Just clicking one button and the app had all required permissions with an easy way of updating/revoking permissions per app.</p>
<p>I know OAuth has some flaws, but API-Keys for users that don’t understand them are way worse IMHO.</p></p>

<p>
<p>First of all sorry for my non fluent english, I only want to say I disagree with most of negative opinion here<img src="/include/images/smilies/smile.png"> so from the beginning. As a player and technics devices user (smartphones, tablets etc) You should be fine with browser interface and few simple inputs, so argument about not so smart players who barely can run their pc is kind of invalid IMO.</p>
<p>Second, with this changes (assuming that You are aware what are You doing) You have easy way to manage what app could read and there is no matter they’re not high risk data. It’s all about that little possibility.</p>
<p>At the end, I really looking forward for some simple url for generating keys for example</p>
<p>account.guildwars2.com/getKey/appName/base64_encode_rights with this kind of link user must loggin into account and they have simple message do you really want to create api key for application xxx with rights yyyy. After that system show key to user and from there is simple copy to clipboard paste into app.</p>
<p>There is no such things like anti-phishing mechanism because it’s not how it’s working You can be phished always and only secure mechanism here is your brain and eyes on url address.</p></p>

<p>This will actually make mobile apps better. Social logins are…problematic on those platforms, and requiring a 3rd-party server for APIs to work is a bit hacky depending on the use case.</p>
<p>I think it’s fair to say they won’t retroactively break apps with new scopes (or at least have no intention to<img src="/include/images/smilies/smile.png">), and if your app can’t handle switching based on available features…well, it should, because that’s always a user’s choice.</p></p>

<p>Yeah, the flow for web-based mobile apps is not going to be very clean, UX-wise. I’m probably going to put QR codes on the API key management page so that native apps can “copy-paste” the key into the application in a gross but somewhat feasible manner.</p></div></blockquote>
<p>You can include all three scenarios:</p>
<ul>
	<li>The raw number for copy/pasting</li>
	<li>A link with a URI scheme that apps can register for (guildwars2apikey://#key# or some such…maybe not quite that raw so it can be expanded later)</li>
	<li>A QR code with that same link</li>
</ul>
<p>The raw number works for websites, the link works for native/mobile apps, and the QR code works for mobile apps from a computer screeen.</p></p>

<p>People are probably going to frown on me for saying this, but I actually like the possibility of having a single API key for more than one the services I use on my account.</p>
<p>Until every app can be granted meaningful separate privileges (the account api is the only authorized API we have right now, correct?) there is no real reason to have separate API keys for every application, other than malicious apps and possible per app throttling. However, the API really doesn’t nor should it ever allow much malicious behavior (and chances are by the time user realizes the app is malicious the damage would be done).</p>
<p>From developer point of view, this change has no real positives… assuming you are already conceptually familiar with OAuth2 and/or have a working implementation you can use. But for developers new to all of this it will lower the barrier to entry, which I think (correct me if wrong), is the goal here. This eliminates the need for writing or using “middleware” style code by being single API secret that is stateless in that it does not expire or have different types.</p></p>

<p>To clarify: there’s no link to create an API key. The user has to go to the account site and create one with the correct permissions on their own. Being able to link to a “create key” page would defeat the purpose of not having a 3rd party redirect to login be the norm.</p>
<p>The key management interface is pretty much the same as the OAuth2 client management interface.</p>

<p>There’s more scopes for endpoints that haven’t been released yet; the “account” permission is basically a required scope that is required by the backends (e.g. the servers the API server talks to) for every request.</p>
<p>As per malicious behavior, I don’t anticipate ever writing an endpoint that isn’t read-only. Due to architectural reasons (wibbly wobbly distributed systems) having the API be able to modify either the character or account blobs is technically infeasible. There are some exceptions to that — I really want to expose guild chat and motd editing and stuff — but for the most part it’ll be read-only everything, so the damage a malicious actor could do is fairly limited.</p></p>

<p>We have an IT skill scale from 1 to 10 while ppl reading the API forum already get a 10 (we’re not talking about coders). In my opinion you need at least a 5 to handle this.</p>
<p>Let me describe this with a little story about a “3 points user”<br>
1) A user starts an application (forum, mobile, voicechat)<br>
2) The application may need its own authentication (e.g. forum login)<br>
3) The user reads an explanation about “API” (what?) and “GuildWars2 Basic Account Information” (what again?)<br>
4) A “direct” link is being provided. The URI points to the API-Key management. <br>
- (Let me just re-think about “fishing” at this point.. no, I don’t want to explain this.)<br>
5) The user enters the correct email adress and password for guildwars2.com<br>
6) Now (s)he’s clicks on “Generate new API key” and is being asked what information to provide for the application.<br>
7) The user gets something like “ADSA165DS1V69A8REV6ASDF” and now has to copy this information to clipboard (let’s guess the user has no problem with copy&amp;paste)<br>
8) Now we can return to the application and paste the API Key (..) into the form</p>
<p>I don’t even want to think about those steps for a “level 1 user” with a fresh installed Windows….</p>
<p>Hey Lawton, <br>
I know this discussion was over before it was started, but I don’t think we will be able to write an “everybodys application” with this need of user IT skill.</p>

<p>Yeah. This <em>has</em> to happen. My API use-case is for mobile devices and, at the very least, you guys providing QR codes will be a big help.</p>
<p>I’m not surprised by the move away from OAuth2. smiley and I have always agreed, and he’s right again, Though, from a business/support standpoint, OAuth2 is untenable; it makes it <em>too</em> easy for players to click-through and grant access to an application without <strong>fully</strong> understanding the ramifications.</p></p>

<p>The process with OpenAuth2 needs a few clicks including authentication at guildwars2.com. Everybody should be able to succeed this and it is a well known process.</p>
<p>I totaly agree that most ppl won’t ever read and just click-through. Even “warning, ArenaNet will provide your wallet, inventory, .. Information for a third party application” will be ignored by some users.</p>
<p>Increasing the need of IT skill won’t change anything. The skill needed for copy&amp;paste of a “weird looking” API key is independet of the awareness of data security.</p>
<p>Do it like Android or do it like Apple, but never do it like Microsoft ..</p>
<p>- You can tell the user and hope that (s)he reads and understands. <br>
- You can try to control (have some kind if contract/ agreement between ANet and) the third party application.<br>
- But you won’t ever change the user behaviour/ awareness with the need of increased IT skill. They simple won’t use the feature or follow a guide making them even less understand the consequences.</p>

<p>
<p>I have a few comments/suggestions about the new API key system. My primary concern is user drop-off, I’m sure it is in everyone’s best interest to get users through the API generation process as easily as possible…</p>
<p>1) “API Keys” in the left menu – on the plus side most users will probably be able to locate this menu option. It would be better if it was a red button.</p>
<p>2) Name and description for the API key – IMO will confuse most users, they will think there are specific things they need to enter here and most likely will drop off. If they read the text they might figure it out, but as we know most people won’t bother to read more than a few words. Additionally most people won’t understand why they are creating an API key in the first place.</p>
<p>3) The permissions check box. While not a problem now since there is only one permission (“account”). I can see this as a show stopper after new permissions are added. App developers need a way to request a minimal set of permissions (perhaps by passing ids on the querystring).</p>
<p>4) After the key is generated there needs to be a button to copy it to the clipboard. The key is long and the font is small, so there is a high probability that it will be copied incorrectly.</p>
<p>I understand management made the decision to remove OAuth, but this doesn’t add any extra protection against phishing.  Given that, I’m not against API keys as an alternative, but there needs to be a way to streamline API key generation and input.</p></p>

<p>I like the idea that different keys have different permissions, gives the tech-savvy option to protect certain info and deal with a possible uproar about elitism. HOWEVER, the experience of generating the key, setting permissions and then instructing to copy-paste needs to be streamlined. I want a way for users to quickly register their info without having to jump all the hoops, currently it’s just easier for guilds to follow the regular shivtr.com path, because it’s less steps (register, then login on any other guild site you want to apply into).  What i propose is enable a ‘Generate API key’ link. The link would redirect to guildwars2.com, then pop up a window with all the permissions the link requests (e.g account, materials, bank) and asks you to accept or refuse, upon success, just redirect to a page that is not cluttered and centers the API key in the web browser in a large font with instructions as to minimalize any PEBCAK. Example of the link would be something like:<br>
<a href="https://account.guildwars2.com/account/generate-api-key?perm=account+bank+materials">https://account.guildwars2.com/account/generate-api-key?perm=account+bank+materials</a><br>
As far as phishing concerns go, i think nothing changes, if this does not take effect, i’m still going to redirect people to account.guildwars2.com but i wont be able to hold their hand once they get there.</p></p>

<p>@Sylfer: Sadly it was already said that there will be no link to generate keys: <a href="/forum-backup/HEADS-UP-OAuth2-being-replaced-next-week">https://forum-en.guildwars2.com/forum/community/api/HEADS-UP-OAuth2-being-replaced-next-week/first#post5033388</a></p>
<p>I was only reading here up until now, but since I am now getting back into developing API tools I think I need to voice my opionion:</p>
<p>Generally I think it is a very bad way to let users generate their API key themself needing to set all the right permissions as this is very prone to errors. This is especially true when there is no way of helping them trought the process. In case of incorrect API permissions some people would probably be fast to claim that apps simply aren’t working and just forget about them (even when the apps would clearly tell the user that his permissions are just wrong, I’ve seen that already and enough of it) which would hurt us developers too.</p>
<p>Since the generation-link proposal was already dismissed how about atleast the feature to let people enter a character representation of the needed flags. For example, when we have sufficient flags just bring them into a binary string and convert this into base64 or even just a normal A-Za-z0-9 interpretation. This way the apps could tell the user to enter “Adz9s2” into a box that will tick the correct boxes (ofcourse this would need some kind of checksum to ensure that typos won’t alter the flags). We could then have an non authenticated API that we feed what flags we need and get the string-representation back to ensure that everyone has the correct strings and we don’t need to depend this on third-party-libraries or selfcoding.</p>
<p>This way we could atleast guide users trought the process, telling them what to enter where. Also, yes I realize that this will still need the users to verify what permissions they will give, but really there’s not much difference to just telling them what to tick, because those who know about risks will check permissions anyway and those who don’t wouldn’t probably understand the impact of the permissions they are giving and just click whatever we tell them.</p></p>

<p>
<p>What about incorporating the flags into the API key generation itself? Check some checkboxes, make a binary representation of the checked flags, append it to the API key after the key was generated. So we could say "Make sure to enable Account, Material, Bank permissions {image}. Make sure the key generated ends with ‘001’ {image} "? So the key creation form would look like:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Key name<br>
List of checkboxes:</li>
	<li>Account</li>
	<li>Materials</li>
	<li>Bank</li>
</ul>
<p>Then it would result in something like this after appending the flag part:<br>
EE6E6BCE-F25F-9B40-B867-4AC09999990ED0F96997-EFB6-469D-A4C9-E5783E8E7D30-001</p>
<p>I’m also a out of my depth and didn’t quite understand slashy’s proposal, i’m not 100% sure what auth tokens have to look like. What is the purpose of converting the flags binary representation into base64? Wouldn’t it just be easier to append tiny binary string at the end of the API key or is my approach not actually feasible?</p>
<p>Also i find the description textbox completely irrelevant, name itself is all the description a key should require, anything beyond that will only confuse people.</p></p>

<p>
<p>With regards to links to generate a key with a given permission set — the reason we moved off OAuth2 was phishing (yes, I know) — basically we don’t want the expected flow to involve a third-party site linking to a login page. So the generate-a-key links are out. My solution for this is to just keep the number of scopes fairly low and with short, concise descriptions. Not going for an EVE-style permission system.</p>
<p>Gonna try to get some fixes into the account management system; they’ll probably land early next week:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Copy to clipboard button next to API keys.</li>
	<li>QR code button next to the clipboard button.</li>

<p>Hmm, I’ll look into adding an endpoint to convert a refresh token to an API key. I can’t promise it’ll be implemented, but it would definitely make the migration much, much cleaner for existing users.</p>

<p>Eh, I can remove it. Name is probably enough. I wasn’t sure how much metadata users wanted to attach to keys, so I erred on the side of caution. I don’t necessarily think that the end-users are as easily confused as the comments of the thread suggest, but realistically you guys are in much closer contact than I am (since they’re your end-users, not mine) so I’ll take your word for it.</p></p>

<p>If your intention is to not have 3rd party sites link to login pages, i don’t expect 3rd party sites that are safe will not just link to <a href="https://account.guildwars2.com/account/api-keys/create">https://account.guildwars2.com/account/api-keys/create</a></p>
<p>The sites that do want to steal you account info wont even care and just still link to their login page instead (you expect the user to know how the authentication process work?)</p>

<p>Fun fact: this was a point i made in the #gww IRC yesterday, transscript below:</p>
<blockquote><div class="quotey"><p>[20:30] &lt;Smiley_&gt; the problem with the oauth redirect actually isn’t that a 3rd-party redirects to a login-page but that the owner of the login page has to make sure that the users can easily identify phishing attempts (ssl server certificate)<br>
[20:31] &lt;Smiley_&gt; (by owner of the login page i mean anet)<br>
[20:32] &lt;Smiley_&gt; so when you see a green “Arenanet, Inc.” on the left side of your address bar, you can be pretty sure, you’re not getting phished<br>
[20:33] &lt;relic&gt; I would not rely on users paying attention to the certificate<br>
[20:34] &lt;Smiley_&gt; thats what i meant with “you cannot mitigate PEBCAK” – there are still people who click links on spam emails<br>
[20:34] &lt;Smiley_&gt; natural selection<br>
[20:37] &lt;relic&gt; API keys means that never happens in the first place though<br>
[20:38] &lt;Smiley_&gt; i could easily make up a site which looks exactly like the gw2 account management<br>
[20:38] &lt;Smiley_&gt; in fact, it’s even worse this way<br>
[20:39] &lt;relic&gt; what, so the application links to a faux official site to login to for an api key?<br>
[20:40] &lt;Smiley_&gt; the same which would redirect to a faux official site to login for oauth2 authorization<br>
[20:40] &lt;Smiley_&gt; now tell me whats worse?<br>
[20:43] &lt;relic&gt; both seem equally bad to me<br>
[20:43] &lt;Smiley_&gt; right<br>
[20:43] &lt;Smiley_&gt; so now what’s the advantage of api keys over oauth2?<br>
[20:46] &lt;relic&gt; the user is only vulnerable at the one point they go in to generate an api key right? rather than every app authorization?<br>
[20:47] &lt;Smiley_&gt; ideally you’d have to create a different key for each application, so the risk is potentially the same<br>
[20:49] &lt;relic&gt; sec, I should check the management page lol<br>
[20:51] &lt;relic&gt; but you are doing it from the official website<br>
[20:52] &lt;relic&gt; A faux website couldn’t replicate the keys you manage as well even if they got everything else right<br>
[20:52] &lt;Smiley_&gt; you still have to get there first – how many users do have it open in a tab all the time  and how many would just click the lazy link on the 3rd party site “go here to create an api key”<br>
[20:52] &lt;Smiley_&gt; you don’t need to create the key<br>
[20:53] &lt;Smiley_&gt; as a phisher you want the login data<br>
[20:53] &lt;Smiley_&gt; the damage is done in the moment you click “log in” on a faux login site<br>
[20:57] &lt;relic&gt; with oauth, if you are already logged in with a session key, you can authorize immediately<br>
[20:57] &lt;relic&gt; having the person login to a fauz official website seems much harder to phish with<br>
[20:59] &lt;relic&gt; I think that method would happen just as much whether you use oauth or api key :/<br>
[21:00] &lt;Smiley_&gt; right, thats why verified ssl certificates matter<br>
[21:02] &lt;relic&gt; how does that make a difference?<br>
[21:02] &lt;Smiley_&gt; that green thing in the address bar jumps at you<br>
[21:03] &lt;Smiley_&gt; see: <a href="https://github.com/">https://github.com/</a><br>
[21:03] &lt;relic&gt; no kitten, what is the difference in regards to oauth and api key methods?<br>
[21:04] &lt;Smiley_&gt; oauth is user friendly, also the token exchange happens between the servers<br>
[21:05] &lt;Smiley_&gt; you have to keep in mind that the api key is basically the access token in oauth2 which noone would see (except the database owner maybe)</p></div></blockquote>
<p>Plus: API keys are useless for user authorization, which may be pretty handy for e.g. character websites</p></p>

<p>There’s a very large difference between one-off processes (API keys) vs. doing something multiple times a day (OAuth2 for authentication). Acclimating your users to have to log in all the time makes it easy for even some of the ones that pay attention to that stuff to make a mistake.</p></p>

<p>You only have to log in once with OAuth2 if you give the application permission to refresh its authentication key.</p></p>

<p>As already mentioned, this isn’t true<br>
You should already know this as you were the one who pointed out that refresh tokens wouldn’t be very useful if they expired after a day <a href="/forum-backup/Launching-v2-account-w-Authentication">https://forum-en.guildwars2.com/forum/community/api/Launching-v2-account-w-Authentication/page/2#post4843172</a></p>
<p>The only difference that actually means something between OAuth2 and the API Key system. Is that in OAuth2, the clients browser will convey the required information after login, however in the API Key system, the user will have to convey the required information after login</p>
<p>That is the only difference and it doesn’t do anything in terms of security, it only makes it harder for everyone involved</p>
<p>Disclaimer, i know that OAuth2 has refresh tokens and the 3rd party site need to request a refresh token from the guildwars2.com api with the information returned by the client browser, etc, but it doesn’t mean anything in terms of functionallity when comparing it to the API Key system</p></p>

<p>OAuth2 “supports” and enables the login-style usage, and there’s no real way to disable it, so it will get used. API keys absolutely don’t let you do that. There is a pretty big difference.</p></p>

<p>Technical constraints currently prevent adding new permissions to an existing key. I haven’t decided whether or not it’s something we should fix, since having a fixed permission set seems like it would be more straightforward for application developers (e.g., if you’ve got a key, it’ll continue working until it’s entirely revoked).</p></p>

<p>While I see this as a good change, my biggest issue with this is that the account management website is not built for mobile display. Both the login and the API key page. This means that if we want users to create/copy their API keys on a mobile device, they have to try and find the right touch points and copy text from a very hard to touch text area. Are there plans to make this experience more user friendly?<br>
I’ve attached two screenshots from my phone to show examples.</p></p>

<p>I think the third-party will already have to use scope-filtering regardless. So any time a request is made, the third-party app should already make sure the key has the necessary permission, if not handle the exception. So i don’t personally see why you can’t edit the keys. If you check key validity only upon linking, i think that’s a poor practice and you’ll eventually have to handle the exception of key being revoked during a request to API (in which case why not already handle the exception of inadequate permission upon request). If there’s a flaw in my logic or this somehow complicates the coding side / user experience feel free to point it out.</p></p>

<p>The current implementation for API keys internally use OAuth2 refresh tokens — the difference is that the account site is the OAuth2 client. Since the OAuth2 backend prohibits an OAuth2 token from adding new scopes, it’s just something we have to live with for the time being (though technically, we can add the ability to remove scopes, but that seems silly).</p></p>

<p>Since the ‘big boom’ yesterday, we get this error for some of our API Keys:<br>
{"text":"ErrBadData"}</p>
<p>We were not able to reproduce this issue.<br>
Lawton, is send you a PM with an API Key having this problem (hopefully it won’t be deleted by the user).</p></p>

<p>Can confirm, not a single one of my old or newly generated keys work no matter the permissions</p></p>

<p>
<p>Update:</p>
<p>We were not able to force this issue, but we were now able to reproduce it by generating another API Key for the same GW2 account.</p>
<p>Even this seems to be random.</p></p>

<p>Whoops, thanks for the heads up; I’ve pinged the appropriate people.</p>
<p>Keys will work for any account that hasn’t logged in since the hotfix this morning, I think. Anyone who’s logged in since then will be inaccessible until we redeploy a server that got missed.</p></p>

<p>One super minor change I’d like to suggest…BTW I appreciate the streamlining of the New API Key form, removal of the description field, but the text on the page is out of date.</p>
<p>FROM…<br>
Set a name, description, and set of permissions for this key. The name and description fields are for your use. The permissions set which features you’d like this key to grant, and they cannot be modified after key creation.</p>
<p>TO…(something like this)</p>
<p>Create a name and set permissions for this key. The name field is for your use. The permissions control which features you’d like this key to grant, and they cannot be modified after key creation.</p></p>

<p>Oh wow, yeah, totally overlooked that.</p>
<p>That’s gonna take a couple of days to update since the strings need to be localized, but it’ll land eventually. Thanks for pointing that out!</p></p>

<p>Essentially, this current system is basically no different from asking the user to create a secondary password (hoping they will make more than one, but not forcing it), and therefore suffers from all the same issues as normal password security.</p>
<p>Would it not be possible to make application developers register a specific key for each app? That would at least avoid some of the security implications of ‘shared’ api keys, and would also give ANet a better way of getting in touch with app developers.</p>
<p>The user would be provided with the app key from the application, and then needs to log in to the GW2 account page and paste the key provided by the app into the GW2 account site. From the point of view of user flow, it’s identical to the current system, but would be slightly more secure, and less prone to user error.</p>
<p>i.e.</p>
<p>I go to register for an app, provide my email and instead of being asked to go and generate a specific key, I instead get provided with a key from the app. The key might be along the lines of</p>
<p>{APPKEY}-{APPSCOPES}-{USEREMAIL}<br>
GH78bgt7KK-001-user@domain.com</p>
<p>You’d still require the user to validate using the GW2 account website before anything works, but you’d also have a unique key for each user-app-scope combo that can be revoked by the user, and the authorisation flow from the user would be less complex and less prone to users creating unforeseen security complication for themselves by reusing keys over and over again.</p>
<p>You could even add a further layer of security by considering that key to be the public key, and requiring the app to use a private key to authenticate the user. The private key would be created when the user adds the key to the account site, and instead of requiring the user to copy and paste, gets sent to a listener url that the developer provided when requesting the app key.</p></p>

<p>I don’t think it would be a good idea to try and reinvent OAuth just to be different. It should either be simple or OAuth. The devs also already said that they won’t be doing that when people asked for links to create a key with specific permissions.</p></p>

<p>This will be feasible once the <a href="https://github.com/arenanet/api-cdi/pull/27">/v2/tokeninfo</a> comes out (hopefully today if nothing else lights itself on fire) — you can give the user a unique string to put in the token’s “name” field, then validate that the key is the one you requested.</p>
<p>It’s not entirely foolproof, but I think it’s probably as close as we’ll be able to get <img src="/include/images/smilies/sad.png"></p></p>

<p>You’re right, Google, Facebook, Twitter, Spotify and many other leaders are totally wrong using OAuth 2.0.</p>
<p>I’m trolling.</p>

<p>
<p>Now that we have been using API keys for quite some time now, I have to say its not nearly as bad as most people in this thread (including me) anticipated.</p>
<p>OAuth 2.0 has definitely some advantages (easier to create and manage for users), but creating API keys isn’t too bad. And once they are created, API keys are way easier to work with from a developer standpoint, no refresh tokens, callbacks, …, just storing the API key for each user and sending it with each request.</p></p>

<p>
<p>There is still the major issue of authenticity which with the API key system is horrible as it is right now and it seems the dev aren’t really interested in making it easier for the moment being</p>
<p>If you do not care about authenticity , then it isn’t that bad, if you do care about it, then it is much worse</p>
<p>This simple 10 min fix would make it so much easier for the user <a href="/forum-backup/API-Creation-Page-Input-Insertion">https://forum-en.guildwars2.com/forum/community/api/API-Creation-Page-Input-Insertion</a> but still a worse overall</p></p>

<p>The decision on those sorts of questions is out of our hands, and the decision on that is no.</p>
<p>Sorry, we’ll do the best we can within the constraints we’re under.</p></p>
