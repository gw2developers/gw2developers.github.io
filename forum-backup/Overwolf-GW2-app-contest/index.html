<p>I think it’s a shame that a contest that started almost 2 months ago is posted in the news only just now – 26.08. with just 2 more weeks till its end date. Imho such contests should be put on the news site asap.<br>
I, for example, had I known it earlier I’d definitely give it a try, and even now, if it wasn’t for the fact I’ll be off for 2 weeks.<br>
Such a shame ANet<img src="/include/images/smilies/sad.png"></p></p>

<p>I’ve got other worries. The idea of a contest might be great, but some of the ideas presented here: <a href="http://developers.overwolf.com/guild-wars-2-app-ideas/">http://developers.overwolf.com/guild-wars-2-app-ideas/</a> sound like they would mean a high rate of automization and clearly would give an advantage to players using the app. As some of you might know, ANets policy towards third party software is “anything that gives advantage is forbidden”. I don’t want to invest time in an app which then is rejected cause it violates the ToS.</p>
<p>Here’s the official statement concerning 3rd party tools: <a href="https://forum-en.guildwars2.com/forum/support/account/Policy-3rd-Party-Programs-Multi-Boxing-Macros/first#post354869">https://forum-en.guildwars2.com/forum/support/account/Policy-3rd-Party-Programs-Multi-Boxing-Macros/first#post354869</a></p></p>

<p>
<p>Some of the API endpoints appear broken as well…  <a href="https://forum-en.guildwars2.com/external?l=https%3A%2F%2Fapi.guildwars2.com%2Fv1%2Fworld_names.json">https://forum-en.guildwars2.com/external?l=https%3A%2F%2Fapi.guildwars2.com%2Fv1%2Fworld_names.json</a> for example returns a 404. There are others as well.</p>
<p>I’ve tried futzing with the GW2 API before, and it’s really annoying. In order to efficiently do lookups you must create your own database of information. For example, if you want to know the status of Garrison on the green WvW map for the Blackgate-Jade Quarry-Tarnished Coast matchup, that would require multiple API calls each requiring some heavy-handed client-side joining.</p>
<p>My hats off to GW2Spidy which I assume does exactly what I mentioned about building your own database.</p>
<p>I registered for this before I remembered how painful the API is. I feel bad saying that because it’s <strong>really awesome</strong> an MMO company even made an API available for game data, it’s just not great to work with.<img src="/include/images/smilies/sad.png"></p></p>

<p>
<p>For what it’s worth, my plan was to build a “watch list” overlay for use in WvW that would allow you to create a list of n objectives, and get notifications if one of those objectives were taken. I think it would be quite useful for scouting and commanding, and also well within the guidelines &amp; spirit of the “give no advantage” terms of the ToS.</p>
<p>If anyone wants to give it a whirl, go for it.</p></p>

<p>Yes. I discussed this scenario with the WvW team, and they’re totally OK with this usage of our APIs.</p>

<p>Thanks for the hint – I didn’t know of the mumble-stuff. I thought I had to screenshot the map and get the player’s position from comparing it to a reference map. That would have been hell.</p></p>

<p>
<p>Considering the fact that the events API, a major component, has been broken ever since the megaserver was first introduced, I feel that there has not been enough emphasis within ArenaNet to support their own API.</p>
<p>I strongly suspect that within ArenaNet, developers working on the API are constantly being pulled to work on the game instead, since that has always been the higher priority.  As a developer, I am concerned that the API work has been on pause for an extended period of time.</p></p>

<p>Nice one<img src="/include/images/smilies/wink.png"></p>
<p>One of the issue that robotempire.2451 pointed out regarding the api being broken, is kind of a shame for Anet to put a awesome contest like this but not fixing is API first, i know that there’s a workaround for the world names(i use it myself on the WordPress plugin for WvW stats)</p>
<p>but who grant us that with the next release another endpoint just breaks ( for example the matches.json) and then what was a great application is just useless due to the fact that the API is not working.</p>
<p>I think is a great initiative, but would be great to have the API fixed first and ensure that even if breaks, we have fail-over endpoints</p></p>

<p>Yeah, it’s a nice coincidence, my Overlay App <a href="http://gw2co.net">http://gw2co.net</a> also went to public beta 10 days ago.</p>
<p>And yes, a fix for the API would be the first thing before starting a contest.</p>
<p>Does anyone know whether the Overwolf API does even handle the Mumble Data Link?</p>

<p>As interesting as it sounds I would like to know what they gonna do with the winning apps. Do the creators lose the rights to them? Are they going to distribute them, and IF so, will they be available as freeware, or would they try to charge for them (and in such case, does the creator gets royalties from sales…), or can developer distribute the app for free/fee themselves? Just wondering, is all.</p></p>

<p>Hey there!</p>
<p>Those are all really good questions which I’ll happily answer.</p>
<p>You as the creator have full rights over your app forever to do with as you wish. We (Overwolf) will distribute your app as a free download to anyone who uses the Overwolf overlay.</p>
<p>Currently, we only offer apps for free. In the future we will implement a system where if the developer of the app wishes they can charge for the app (this is only if the developer wishes, we do not decide this). If the app becomes a paid app, the creator gets percentages of the app sales.</p>
<p>Hopes this answers your questions!</p></p>

<p>GW2PAO was good inspiration (that’s actually what prompted me to work on my stuff), too bad I can’t use it, which is why I’m writing three (well, two, the WvW one is already done) Overwolf apps to replace it.</p>

<p>GW2PAO was good inspiration (that’s actually what prompted me to work on my stuff), too bad I can’t use it, which is why I’m writing three (well, two, the WvW one is already done) Overwolf apps to replace it.</p>
