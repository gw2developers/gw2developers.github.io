Most people wil go chatting with friends so I thought if the make whisper/group/sqaud/guild chats seperate you stil can help others while waiting and still can contact players you “might” know. <br>\nOfc. Inbox mail would be handy also but then without attachments like gold/items. So you have kinda a read only and responding.</p>\n<p>Can be handy if need to contact some1 but only have acces to mobile and you aint like to give personal information like mobile number/emailadres. Short said keep your own gw2 privacy.</p>\n<p>As security you can for example only attached mobile number to gw2 account can get into it so you prevent hacking or system abuse aswel</p>","arenanet":false}]}
