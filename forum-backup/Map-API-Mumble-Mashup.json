If you do redistribute Plotty, please at least give me credit.<img src=\"/include/images/smilies/wink.png\"></p>\n<p>Edit: Just added global hot key support and a new favourites data field on coordinates, so you can enable the option to have Plotty listen for an in-game key press (eg: F12, CTRL+G etc). When Plotty hears the keypress it will mark the captured location to the db as a ‘favourite’ location. You can then extract just the favourites from the History db, and I’ve also added a customisable JSON export option – allowing a user to quickly create a json data set.</p>","arenanet":false},{"pubDate":"2016-11-11T18:45:22.000Z","guid":"http://forum-en.guildwars2.com/forum/community/api/Map-API-Mumble-Mashup/6397151","author":"SturmGhost.5817","body":"\n<p>Fixed my problems.

For the server, Python, as it makes a lot of things very simple – although, the server itself should be fairly small, little more than a registry of player positions with a pretty JavaScript front-end.

The Bonjour service would be used to report to the client what the updated port number would be so the client can still find the service regardless of the service port number which can differ each time.  I may not have a web server running before installing the ArenaNet service, but I may still decide to install a web server in the future and as a user, I don’t want to have to resolve any port conflicts ever.  Bonjour is designed to do away with such unneeded limitations.</p>\n<p>Requiring apps to run on the same machine is not acceptable as that would exclude mobile devices like Androids, iPhones/iPads, etc from running apps to interface with the proposed ArenaNet service.  Excluding ArenaNet services from the huge and ever growing mobile space would defeat the purpose of them releasing APIs in the first place.</p>","arenanet":false},{"pubDate":"2013-06-24T18:33:37.000Z","guid":"http://forum-en.guildwars2.com/forum/community/api/Map-API-Mumble-Mashup/2274178","author":"Varonth.5830","body":"\n<blockquote><div class=\"citey\"><cite title=\"Posted on June 24 2013 04:01PM\"><a href=\"/forum/community/api/Map-API-Mumble-Mashup/2273309\">DarkSpirit.7046:</a></cite></div><div class=\"quotey\"><blockquote><div class=\"citey\"><cite title=\"Posted on June 24 2013 01:45PM\"><a href=\"/forum/community/api/Map-API-Mumble-Mashup/2272575\">Varonth.5830:</a></cite></div><div class=\"quotey\"><p>Bonjour isn’t pre-installed on windows machines afaik.</p></div></blockquote>\n<p>That should not matter as developers can package their apps with free Bonjour redistributables under the Apache 2.0 license.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/softwarelicensing/agreements/bonjour.html\">https://developer.apple.com/softwarelicensing/agreements/bonjour.html</a></p>\n<p>Not sure if that would be a problem for ArenaNet as I am not a legal expert, but it seems ok on the surface.</p>\n<p>The problem with just using TCP on a user machine to serve out information, without something like Bonjour, is that you do not know for sure if a particular port that you want to use, is available.

From what I understand, GW2 is following the generic plugin API for mumble, which is just to open a memory mapped file with a specific identifier, and start writing position updates to it.

That overlay app could also sync with a server and allow each user of the app to send commands another user, and share waypoints.

I just wanted to post it here so that you guys can see it and get some more information about it.</p>\n<p>The idea is to use the mumble link plugin protocol to get your character’s position from the game client, which could then be used to plot your character’s position on a map.</p>\n<p>Guild Wars 2 supports mumble’s 3d-positional voice chat, which means that GW2 mumble users will hear other players relative to their positions in the game world.</p>\n<p>The protocol is described here: <a href=\"http://mumble.sourceforge.net/Link\">http://mumble.sourceforge.net/Link</a> . An app would simply need to create or open the memory mapped file described in the protocol, and GW2 would automatically write the character’s position to that file.</p>\n<p>Some implementation notes:</p>\n<ul>\n\t<li>The coordinate system used by mumble is slightly different than the game. GW2 uses inches (don’t ask), but mumble uses meters. So you’ll need to convert the coordinates back to inches for use with the map API.</li>\n\t<li>The game currently supplies the current map ID inside the ‘context’ binary blob. However, it doesn’t currently supply which floor the character is on or which interior the character has entered.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I’m not sure how the mumble server protocol works, but theoretically you could tap into the mumble client to get the positions of everyone else on your mumble server too.</p>","arenanet":true}]}
