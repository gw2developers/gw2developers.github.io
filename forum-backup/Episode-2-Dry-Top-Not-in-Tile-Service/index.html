<p>I noticed that the part of the map added in Episode 2 of the Living Story has not been added to the Tile Service yet. is there a reason behind it? if so, i would like to know whats going on with that, since that part is kinda missing for my live map as of now.</p></p>

<p>
<p>If there is a technical reason, it has to be because Dry Top was released in two parts. I guess they never tested for that scenario when they designed the backend for the tiles service.</p>
<p>Fun fact: the official Atlas has the same problem: <a href="http://atlas.guildwars2.com/en/#/map">http://atlas.guildwars2.com/en/#/map</a></p></p>

<p>well, they would just have to take the ingame map as it is now and cut that up into 2^n by 2^n pieces. shouldnt take that much effort. plus, if it was an issue, i dont think we would have the first half of the map in there either. I find it kinda silly when the api provides the poi and waypoints for that area, but you dont have the map for it. :/</p></p>

<p>That’s because the Atlas <strong>uses</strong> the tile service.</p>

<p>That’s already how the map is stored in Gw2.dat.  Sometime last year I had gone to the trouble of extracting all the tiles and setting up my own custom map using the Google Maps API, but it was too much work so I mothballed the project.</p></p>

I highly dislike that my “live” map has a waypoint sitting in a covered part of dry top, because for some odd reason they updated that part of the api, but not all of it. :/</p></p>

<p>My thought is:<br>
May be they are holding it back.<br>
In the game you have to discover the areas before it is displayed in the game.<br>
So may be it’s so you don’t get a spoiler of the area.</p></p>

<p>It’s not that easy, for three reasons.  First, the in-game map is actually two sets of tiles: the painterly background and the detailed foreground.  Second, the detail textures are set up with transparency layers necessary for the underwater areas.  Third, the detail textures extend beyond the in-game boundaries.</p>
<p>So that’s three steps necessary to transform the textures into map tiles: 1) remove the underwater transparency from the detail textures and overlay a solid blue/green color on the underwater regions; 2) enforce the zone boundaries on the detail textures; 3) overlay the detail textures onto the background textures.</p></p>

<p>while that does sound like some work, only very few tiles would have to be updated. then again, just updating a few of them instead of all of them might be another issues. But one way or another, It has been 3 weeks now since that map has been added. Isnt there an api specific dev team, or are they all working on the living story at the moment? rhetoric question to some degree i suppose since you prolly wont know either.</p></p>
