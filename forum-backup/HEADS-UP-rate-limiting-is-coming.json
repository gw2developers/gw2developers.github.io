This is going to be a bumpy transition, but here’s what I’m thinking so far —</p>\n<ul>\n\t<li>The rate limit is per-IP,</li>\n\t<li>Global across all endpoints (e.g., separate endpoints do not have separate rate limits),</li>\n\t<li>Is (probably) tracked on a per-minute basis, and</li>\n\t<li>Is continuously updated, rather than resetting at a specific interval.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The main change is that, upon reaching the rate limit, more requests just return “HTTP 429 Limit Exceeded” with the response body {\"error\":“rate limit exceeded”}. Rate-limited requests <em>still</em> count against the limit (this is an implementation detail of the existing backend service that manages limits). Additionally, responses will contain a new header:</p>\n<ul>\n\t<li>X-Rate-Limit-Limit is the maximum number of requests that may be issued within a minute. This is a static value doesn’t contain count for requests you have already sent.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>At some point in the future I’d like to add X-Rate-Limit-Remaining, which would contain the actual number of requests that can still be made before hitting the limit, but that needs more extensive backend changes to support.</p>\n<p>For the actual limit, the current number I’m thinking of is 600 requests/minute. I think that’s enough to pull all of the trading post listings every 30 seconds (which is how long they’re cached for). The limit is a rolling limit, so if an application makes 600 requests, then waits for 30 seconds, it should be able to make another 300 requests without going over.</p>\n<p>This isn’t set in stone yet, so let me know if you have feedback/concerns/questions. Rate limiting <em>does</em> need to be implemented before the API can be turned back on, though, otherwise the API will just continue falling over. I would like to get everything back up and running on Monday, but the schedule might slip a bit if something unexpected happens.</p>","arenanet":true}]}
