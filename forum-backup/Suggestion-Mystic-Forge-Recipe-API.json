I want it so much, I went and manually made a bunch of the them.  If you want, I could create a text file with all of them in json format, similar to how the recipe_details.json looks.<br>\nspecifically, I have:<br>\nlegendaries<br>\ngifts<br>\nclovers (it uses the average amount of the ingredients it takes)<br>\nmystic weapons<br>\nthe other SP weapons (the ones that use eldritch scroll)<br>\nsuperior siege<br>\nRecipe: Box of Armors (I haven’t confirmed them yet, that would take more sp than I have, but theoretically they’re right)<br>\nRecipe: Feast of Food / Recipe: Pot of Food / Recipe: Tray of Food (I haven’t confirmed them yet, that would take more sp than I have, but theoretically they’re right)<br>\nmaterial promotions (the output_item_count is the average you get)<br>\na few other misc things (like mystic salvage kit and improved experience booster)</p>\n<p>782 total recipes</p>\n<p>I don’t have everything, such as:<br>\nminis<br>\ntonics<br>\nlimited-time recipes (captains council commendations, for example)<br>\nall of the “4 rates -&gt; 1 random rare” type recipes</p>\n<p>but I do have a simple way of generating them (basically just typing out the names and amounts into a function and it finds the right data_id’s from the database).  or what’s also fun is copy/paste a table from the wiki and find/replace<img src=\"/include/images/smilies/wink.png\"></p>\n<p>So, if there is interest in this, let me know and I can put it all together and publish what I have.  And if there is interest in the parts I don’t have, let me know and I’ll work to complete it (also please provide any resources you have that name what all the recipes are)</p>","arenanet":false},{"pubDate":"2014-10-11T17:41:49.000Z","guid":"http://forum-en.guildwars2.com/forum/community/api/Suggestion-Mystic-Forge-Recipe-API/4480190","author":"AysonCurrax.3254","body":"\n<blockquote><div class=\"citey\"><cite title=\"Posted on October 11 2014 03:39PM\"><a href=\"/forum/community/api/Suggestion-Mystic-Forge-Recipe-API/4479992\">smiley.1438:</a></cite></div><div class=\"quotey\"><p>Y U NO USE STICKY?<img src=\"/include/images/smilies/wink.png\"></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://forum-en.guildwars2.com/forum/community/api/API-Suggestion-Items-Recipes-and-Crafting/2083501\">https://forum-en.guildwars2.com/forum/community/api/API-Suggestion-Items-Recipes-and-Crafting/2083501</a></p></div></blockquote>\n<p>One point would be, that i didnt think of said sticky. :x other reason would be that i would like to know if you, my fellow codemonkeys ( or codequaggans if that is prefered) would appreciate it if i made the effort of dishing one out for now, if noone did so already. :P</p>","arenanet":false},{"pubDate":"2014-10-11T15:39:06.000Z","guid":"http://forum-en.guildwars2.com/forum/community/api/Suggestion-Mystic-Forge-Recipe-API/4479992","author":"smiley.1438","body":"\n<p>Y U NO USE STICKY?<img src=\"/include/images/smilies/wink.png\"></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://forum-en.guildwars2.com/forum/community/api/API-Suggestion-Items-Recipes-and-Crafting/2083501\">https://forum-en.guildwars2.com/forum/community/api/API-Suggestion-Items-Recipes-and-Crafting/2083501</a></p>","arenanet":false},{"pubDate":"2014-10-11T10:34:59.000Z","guid":"http://forum-en.guildwars2.com/forum/community/api/Suggestion-Mystic-Forge-Recipe-API/4479649","author":"AysonCurrax.3254","body":"\n<p>Would it be possible to get an official api that offers information about all currently known mystic forge recipes?
