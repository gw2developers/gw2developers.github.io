Indeed the example you wrote in your post has the right attributes subobject but not the right buff subobject. Now ascended (infused) items have infusion slots and not a “+5 Agony Resistance” attribute.</p>","arenanet":false},{"pubDate":"2016-09-10T21:58:47.000Z","guid":"http://forum-en.guildwars2.com/forum/community/api/API-2-items-Infix-upgrade-subobject/6322507","author":"ezd.6359","body":"\n<p>I asked almost the same here (may be not so clear)<br>\n<a href=\"https://forum-en.guildwars2.com/forum/community/api/State-of-buff-in-items-stats-now/\">https://forum-en.guildwars2.com/forum/community/api/State-of-buff-in-items-stats-now/</a></p>\n<p>Still no answer.
