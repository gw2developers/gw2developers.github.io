It also pairs most items with their item code, so that works out.</p>\n<p>First, you need to be able to crawl a wiki page for its item code (the chat code, e.g. ). You can do this by traversing the DOM. There are many DOM traversal libraries, and potentially even some wiki traversing libraries. Take advantage of them.</p>\n<p>Second, please remember to cache. Indefinitely. You only need to find the item code once, because we can use that to get to the item ID. Then you’ll have a permanent local link from item name to item ID.</p>\n<p>I’d suggest using your local API to lookup the item ID from the item name. If it doesn’t exist, query the specific item code from the GW2 wiki and convert that to the ID. (And cache it so it’ll exist in the future.)</p>\n<p>Now, how do we get the item ID from the item code? Luckily, this is pretty well documented in the <a href=\"http://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Chat_link#Item_link\">Chat link format wiki page</a></p>\n<p>I’ll brief over the basics. Take a look at this chat code for Zojja’s Claymore:<br>\n[&amp;AgGqtgAA]</p>\n<p>Strip the square brackets and the ampersand, and we have…<br>\nAgGqtgAA</p>\n<p>Look familiar? That’s base64, a common type of encryption. By <a href=\"http://tomeko.net/online_tools/base64.php?lang=en\">converting this base64 to hex</a>, we get the following:<br>\n0201AAB60000</p>\n<p>Let’s make this easier to read.<br>\n02 01 AA B6 00 00</p>\n<p>Now, each of these areas means something specific. That’s all detailed in the aforementioned Chat link format wiki page. But let’s not get into all those details.</p>\n<p>This format changes depending on the item type and what the chat code is for (i.e. something other than an item), but for most items, it appears that the format here is quite consistent.</p>\n<p>Let’s get the item ID. First, we need to do is strip the first couple bytes.<br>\nAA B6 00 00</p>\n<p>Now, reverse it.<br>\n00 00 B6 AA</p>\n<p>Remove the spaces…<br>\n0000B6AA</p>\n<p>Alright, now we have little endian hex. If we <a href=\"http://www.darkfader.net/toolbox/convert/\">convert that to a decimal</a>, we get…<br>\n46762</p>\n<p>Ta-da. The item ID!
