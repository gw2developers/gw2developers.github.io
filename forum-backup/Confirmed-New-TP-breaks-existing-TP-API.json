It seems that they not care at all about API users. Why are we wasting our time and resources to provide services about a game that do not care about us and do not inform us about new/changing features?</p>\n<p>This is about the same situation of when megaserver break API v1. <br>\nI’m scared that if this is the way ArenaNet work, we have only to wait until a next breaking change without any advice. They will stop after the third breaking change? I don’t think so…</p>","arenanet":false},{"pubDate":"2014-09-05T21:18:35.000Z","guid":"http://forum-en.guildwars2.com/forum/community/api/Confirmed-New-TP-breaks-existing-TP-API/4369326","author":"StevenL.3761","body":"\n<p>At least there is some communication now. What bothers me more is that they demonstrated the /v2/quaggans endpoint, but never even mentioned the /v2/commerce endpoints. If /v2/commerce were ready, wouldn’t they have told us that on the live stream when that one person asked about the APIs?</p>","arenanet":false},{"pubDate":"2014-09-05T20:41:18.000Z","guid":"http://forum-en.guildwars2.com/forum/community/api/Confirmed-New-TP-breaks-existing-TP-API/4369235","author":"Ekhetrima.9651","body":"\n<p>In today’s Points of Interest, it was mentioned that the old trading post API will no longer work.
