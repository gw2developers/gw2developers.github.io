<p>
<p>The WvW community of my server uses the API keys to check if someone is from our server before they are allowed in the TS WvW channels.</p>
<p>Now, since F2P accounts have access to the API and can join whatever server they want, they are also able to get API keys that say that they are from our server, while their main account might be on a different server.</p>
<p>This is not ideal for WvW. But it can be solved pretty easily.<br>
One is to disallow the access to the API of F2P players (which is not really ideal). Two is to add an entry to /v2/account that shows if the account is a F2P or B2P account. This way we can check if it’s a bought account.</p>
<p>I think the the latter one is the better option. It would still allow the F2P accounts get access to the API, while still having our TS WvW channels be clear of “possible spies”.</p></p>

<p>
<p>This is why I asked in <a href="/forum-backup/Free-to-Play-Accounts-access-to-API">https://forum-en.guildwars2.com/forum/community/api/Free-to-Play-Accounts-access-to-API/</a><br>
!!!!!!</p>
<p>Anet is going to great lengths in locking down F2P accounts to protect the game/economy/etc..  Server communities have a shared interest in protection too.  If the API exposed the account type and we could block authorization using that information, it would be one more incentive for the legit user to purchase a full account.</p></p>

<p>Hmm, I’ll look into adding a flag on /v2/account.</p>
<p>I hadn’t considered that at all.</p></p>

<p>Maybee a Flag called “wvw” is the best one.</p>
<p>It can be 1 for a normal account.<br>
And 0 for a Free 2 Play Account, but automatic set to 1 if one character arrived level 60<img src="/include/images/smilies/wink.png"></p></p>

<p>Mmm I think having an account-type indicator would make more sense here. Maybe just have a flag to indicate one of 3 types: Free, Core, or HoT. We could then determine for ourselves if the account has access to WvW – Free with a level 60 (or higher) character, or Core/HoT.</p></p>

<p>This flag could also be used for other things. Say a Raid planner in a guild website would allow people to be warned if they can’t join the raid when they are planning it.</p></p>

<p>For the case the player didn’t delete the character.<br>
If the player delete the 60+ character (reason: try another class or something, they have only 2 character slots), the account is activate then for wvw, but you can’t proof it without a flag.<br>
So the player is in wvw, but did not get access for it. <br>
Yeah i know, this is some special case<img src="/include/images/smilies/smile.png"></p></p>

<p>Ah, good point. I originally was under the impression that it was on a per-character basis, but <a href="https://help.guildwars2.com/entries/95982157-Account-types-Free-Core-HoT">the FAQ</a> does show that it unlocks account wide after 1 character reaches 60…</p></p>
