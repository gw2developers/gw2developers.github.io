Just make sure to activate the salvage kit after the search bar gains focus. It’ll start the salvage thing, but let you type still. By typing “fine,” “ork,” and “rare,” you’ll restrict your inventory to displaying anything with those letters in their description.</p>","arenanet":false},{"pubDate":"2016-07-07T00:21:28.000Z","guid":"http://forum-en.guildwars2.com/forum/community/api/Need-some-help/6234979","author":"Tomiyou.3790","body":"\n<blockquote><div class=\"citey\"><cite title=\"Posted on July 05 2016 10:20PM\"><a href=\"/forum/community/api/Need-some-help/6233404\">Aidan Savage.2078:</a></cite></div><div class=\"quotey\"><blockquote><div class=\"citey\"><cite title=\"Posted on July 04 2016 10:34AM\"><a href=\"/forum/community/api/Need-some-help/6231430\">Tomiyou.3790:</a></cite></div><div class=\"quotey\"><p>Edit: Cleaned up a lot of stuff I found out myself.<br>\nI had a cool idea about writing a program that would allow me to salvage in game items.

I hate micro management in this game so much, due to how the TP interface being so slow (rare sigils during mulitloot…..) and the general interface hides most buttons in a drop down menu, making needless clicks a must.</p>","arenanet":false},{"pubDate":"2016-07-07T00:17:48.000Z","guid":"http://forum-en.guildwars2.com/forum/community/api/Need-some-help/6234975","author":"Tomiyou.3790","body":"\n<blockquote><div class=\"citey\"><cite title=\"Posted on July 05 2016 04:55PM\"><a href=\"/forum/community/api/Need-some-help/6232968\">Anhim.3156:</a></cite></div><div class=\"quotey\"><p>I think you might be posting in the wrong sub-forum.
