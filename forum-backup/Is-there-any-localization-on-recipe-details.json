It’s not a recipe, but an item naming problem. I don’t think there are any recipes that have a name different from the name of the item they create, except:</p>\n<p>There’s a “starter crafting item” on every armor profession.<br>\nArmorsmith example:</p>\n<ul>\n\t<li>Recipe #841 is shown in the crafting UI as “Mighty Chain Legs (Simple)”. It creates level 5 “Mighty Chain Legs” with <em>fine</em> rarity (ID#10730).</li>\n\t<li>Recipe #424 is shown as “Mighty Chain Legs”. It creates level 10 “Mighty Chain Legs”, that also have <em>fine</em> rarity (#10280).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Recipes creating Masterwork, Rare and Exotic items alway get a rarity suffix (Masterwork is renamed to Master probably for space reasons).</p>\n<p>Now, where does that “Simple” suffix come from? Is there special treatment in the UI for the armor starter items? There are no special flags I could find in the API indicating anything about this suffix.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Side note: can we add the corresponding recipe_id to the consumable items that unlock recipes (the ones that have \"Recipe : \" in their names)? Currently, there are several of these items that have names differing from the actual recipes (item names) they unlock. I suppose this is not not always intended and it might help us find irregularities easier.</p>","arenanet":false},{"pubDate":"2013-05-23T23:47:43.000Z","guid":"http://forum-en.guildwars2.com/forum/community/api/Is-there-any-localization-on-recipe-details/2081503","author":"smiley.1438","body":"\n<p>I couldn’t find any while browsing my <a href=\"http://wiki-de.guildwars2.com/wiki/Spezial:Beitr%C3%A4ge/Smiley\">wiki contributions</a> - i believe most of them were <a href=\"http://wiki-de.guildwars2.com/wiki/Kategorie:%C3%9Cbersetzungsfehler\">translation errors</a> which (hopefully) have been fixed in the meantime.</p>\n<p>But i’ve found one special case: 3 recipes with the same name which create 3 different items with the same name:<br>\n<a href=\"http://wiki-de.guildwars2.com/wiki/Geheimtrank\">http://wiki-de.guildwars2.com/wiki/Geheimtrank</a><br>\n<a href=\"http://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Mystery_Tonic\">http://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Mystery_Tonic</a></p>","arenanet":false},{"pubDate":"2013-05-23T23:24:01.000Z","guid":"http://forum-en.guildwars2.com/forum/community/api/Is-there-any-localization-on-recipe-details/2081408","author":"Cliff Spradlin.3512","body":"\n<p>Are there any examples of recipe names that are not just “{item name} – {item rarity}”?</p>","arenanet":true},{"pubDate":"2013-05-23T23:03:34.000Z","guid":"http://forum-en.guildwars2.com/forum/community/api/Is-there-any-localization-on-recipe-details/2081310","author":"smiley.1438","body":"\n<p>Well, at least a lot recipe names differ from the actual crafted item in a rarity suffix.
