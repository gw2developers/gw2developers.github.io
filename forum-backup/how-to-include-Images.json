Is there a tutorial that I could look at to implement this? I would love to see some images on my project!  With regards to the types of images, I believe it is those that you have correctly identified, namely guild emblems, skill, inventory and bank icons etc. which have predefined endpoints given already.</p>\n<p>I was wondering though, how this extends to the maps? I can see the Map output in JSON, so does this get converted to images? I’m very much a novice when it comes to these things and am learning as I go along so any resources for this would be fantastic!</p>\n<p>While it is wishful thinking at the moment regarding the character model implementation at this stage, I am still very happy with the level of support the API gives.</p>\n<p>many thanks in advance!</p>","arenanet":false},{"pubDate":"2016-04-12T17:34:54.000Z","guid":"http://forum-en.guildwars2.com/forum/community/api/how-to-include-Images/6093215","author":"Lawton Campbell.8517","body":"\n<blockquote><div class=\"citey\"><cite title=\"Posted on April 12 2016 07:12AM\"><a href=\"/forum/community/api/how-to-include-Images/6092501\">Lycan.8327:</a></cite></div><div class=\"quotey\"><p>Hi guys, I’m not sure if I am missing something but since starting on API development in a nodeJs app recently, I’ve not been able to manage getting images to work.

I basically need to integrate a software renderer into the game engine, then lift only the parts responsible for rendering into a server.
