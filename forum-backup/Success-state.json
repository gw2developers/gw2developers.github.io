They really need another state to show that pre-events are active, which would solve this problem and reduce your multiple requests into a single one.</p>\n<p>Since the states are inconsistent, you have to scan them all for that one active state and hope you don’t miss it. Since some events can be completed fairly quickly, this means at max you have to do these requests every 30 seconds if you don’t have an idea as to when the event was last completed.</p>\n<p>For example, I’ve seen event chains that will display as active-success-warmup, which progresses to success-active-warmup, which progresses to success-success-warmup which progresses to success-success-active which will then reset to success-success-warmup. The problem with this is that if you missed that active state, at multiple points the event could have appeared to be finished, since it’s in between states are the same as when it’s finished. Other chains can vary, for example resetting to warmup-success-success or even worse, showing warmup instead of active and progressing directing to success then back to warmup.</p>","arenanet":false},{"pubDate":"2013-05-22T03:50:35.000Z","guid":"http://forum-en.guildwars2.com/forum/community/api/Success-state/2071264","author":"lujate.5432","body":"\n<p>Any thoughts on this for CoE?
