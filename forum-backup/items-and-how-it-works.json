There were around 200 new items added since midJune or so; of these, I only bother with the weapons and armor, which accounts for around 30 items. What I find odd is that among these new items are the full set of Whispers medium armor, the heavy chest piece of the Vigil armor (and ONLY the heavy chest piece) and the Wayward Wand. None of these are actually new items. They’ve only just now appeared.<br>\nThe Wayward Wand I bring up specifically because I made one last week when I was gearing up to fight Liadri, so I may be directly responsible for it showing up. But I can’t believe that in the two years that this game has been around that none of these things has been created before, particularly the Whisper armor. So what gives? What does it take for the API to ‘see’ an item?</p>\n<p>Other things I found, if you’re curious: several spelling changes, a few name changes to karma armor pieces, and one item possibly removed from the API (a modniir axe). Not sure why that would happen, so I’m thinking it was a failure in my get-request.</p>","arenanet":false}]}
