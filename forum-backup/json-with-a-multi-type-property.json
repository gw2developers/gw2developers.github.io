In those objects there is a property called “value” that can be an <strong>int</strong> or a <strong>bool</strong>.<br>\nMy App in C# returns an error because I have an object that considers “value” as  <strong>int</strong> while it is a <strong>bool</strong>, deserializing. Maybe you don’t know how to do it in C#, but can you tell me, even in Java, how can you deserialize json with a multi-type property?</p>","arenanet":false}]}
