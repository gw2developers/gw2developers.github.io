I don’t know if there’s already an internal list which lists the missions and their statistics by id, but I imagine the public returns looking akin to:</p>\n<pre><code>guild/:id/missions\n[\n{\n\t\"guild_preference\" : [none|wvw|pvp|pve]\n},\n{\n     \"mission_id\" : XX,\n\t \"name\" :       XX,\n\t \"difficulty\" : XX,\n\t \"icon\" :       XX,\n\t \"type\" :      [pvp|pve|wvw],\n\t \"completed\" : [0|1],\n\t \"favor\" :     XX\n}\n]</code></pre>\n<p>Or maybe mission preference can go into the general guild/:id/ results?</p>\n<p>Thank you for taking all of these suggestions; if there’s a better place/way for me to make them, I’m happy to oblige!</p>","arenanet":false}]}
