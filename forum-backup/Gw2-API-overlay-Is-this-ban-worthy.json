Supposedly user was banned for cheating but was only running the common GW2 stuff API world event overlay.  Although I don’t know what really happened, it makes me very curious and cautious to using anything with the API.</p>\n<p>Obviously I have a few questions about this.</p>\n<p>1) Since Anet has released API information, are developers allowed to write programs using this information or is this limited to just browser based displays such as gw2temple.com?</p>\n<p>2) Although as stated in a thread above that Anet can not “pre approve” programs, is a program running API released to see timer of world events a bankable offense?</p>\n<p>Thanks so much. Hopefully this might help clear up some issues for the community.</p>","arenanet":false}]}
