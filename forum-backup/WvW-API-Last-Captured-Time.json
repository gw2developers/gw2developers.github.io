However, it is not an “always on” application, so when you start it again it does not know how long something has been held, unless it flips again while the app is running.</p>\n<p>The obvious solution to this problem is to have a server which is always on keep track of this, and query that server for the last capture time. However, before I run off and try to set this up, I figured I should ask. Is there is public resource for doing this that I could be tapping into, instead of re-inventing the wheel?</p>","arenanet":false}]}
