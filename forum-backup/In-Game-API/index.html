<p>
<p>Hi there, im interested in making an app that allows kittener to manage their ingame account without beeing actually logged in the game, specially accessing the trading post: seeing recently bought items, selling or buying items etc… In the api: <a href="http://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/API">http://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/API</a> there is nothing mentioned about a possible link to ingame-account without the game beeing physically opend but in this topic: <a href="/forum-backup/Guide-to-the-Black-Lion-Trading-Co-API">https://forum-en.guildwars2.com/forum/community/api/Guide-to-the-Black-Lion-Trading-Co-API</a> , i quote: “Is it possible to buy with this api or merely watch prices?” Response: <br>
“Yes it is possible to buy. For buy, you have to do a https post<br>
<a href="https://tradingpost-live.ncplatform.net/ws/item/&lt;itemId&gt;/buy">https://tradingpost-live.ncplatform.net/ws/item/&lt;itemId&gt;/buy</a><br>
with the following parameters:<br>
{count=int,price=int,charid=&lt;char guid&gt;}<br>
You also need your game session key.”</p>
<p>The problem is that, that topic is 1 year old and I guess the api got updated since “<a href="https://tradingpost-live.ncplatform.net/ws/item/&lt;itemId&gt;/buy">https://tradingpost-live.ncplatform.net/ws/item/&lt;itemId&gt;/buy</a>” is not an accessible link, or I mostly get errors. The (my guess) new format, <a href="http://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/API:2/commerce/listings">http://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/API:2/commerce/listings</a> is much more friendly.</p>
<p>This guy in the topic said that some things like checking if you bought new items and such, is possible, but thats with the old API. Since I dont find anything in the API wiki related to in-game control, I came here to ask:</p>
<p>Is there something that can be done without the API mentioning it? <br>
If yes: where could I get the information about the in-game info i just mentioned (since its not in the wiki api)? <br>
If no: If the in-game info about an account is not possible, how could that guy did it 1 year ago, but not possible today (or at least i didnt found out how)?</p></p>

<p>That post is talking about the (unofficial) API from the previous trading post. It was not supported by ArenaNet publicly and was only supposed to be used from the TP in-game. It got removed in favor of the new TP.</p>
<p>Also, the new API you mentioned (the /v2 endpoint) only works one-way. There is no official way to manage your stuff outside the client. And for the rest, /v2 still gets updated with new TP stuff, but it may take a while.</p></p>

<p>Thanks for reply, probably the reason to not allow players to interact with the TP from another source that is not through the game is that bad things could probably happen, like stealing accounts with their gold etc… However, if this would become possible one day (manage TP from outside game), there is no reason for “bad things” to happen if the programmer sets up secured connections between the web app and anet server.</p></p>

<p>We have no plans to ever support buying/selling things on the trading post outside the game.</p></p>

<p>To elaborate a little bit more on how the other guy was able to access TP in such way outside of the game:</p>
<p>GW2’s TP relied on a http connection, which made it easily possible to replicate the requests and fetch the necessary tokens</p>
<p>Since then the TP has been updated and it now uses the game connection/ sockets to transfer data, which ofcourse is encrypted.</p></p>

<p>I bet that guy dug through game files or with a packet sniffer to find out those links. They werent given in any api (since i remember). Reverse code engineering isnt the cleanest way to get those needs …</p></p>

<p>The Trading Post is just a HTML+Javascript web application; back then you could pretty easily read the source to it and figure out how to make the appropriate AJAX requests. We’ve changed how the application communicates to the backend servers though, so it’ll hopefully be a bit more difficult now.</p></p>
