I’m a back-end programmer myself, so believe me when I say I understand where you’re coming from with the “not a trivial thing” response.  We use it all the time.  And the client never believes it!

But you are basically correct, we could provide the ‘game_type’ value (possibly an array) in maps.  I’ll put this on my todo list, but will probably later rather than sooner.</p>","arenanet":true},{"pubDate":"2013-08-28T14:50:13.000Z","guid":"http://forum-en.guildwars2.com/forum/community/api/Suggestion-Add-game-type-to-map-APIs/2720283","author":"Dr Ishmael.9685","body":"\n<p>The item_details API lists the game_types that an item can be used in.  I assume that this game_type is a map-level property, and while it’s relatively obvious for most maps, I think it would still be useful to have this as a return value within maps.json and map_details.json.  It could even be added as a possible query value, allowing applications to restrict the return data to a certain game type instead of having to parse through all maps for all game types.</p>","arenanet":false}]}
