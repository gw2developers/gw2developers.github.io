I’m going to put them on the /v2/account endpoint with the “progression” scope. The current daily progress is kind of a nightmare to expose; I haven’t figured out a good way to handle it.</p>\n<blockquote><div class=\"citey\"><cite title=\"Posted on December 16 2015 05:54PM\"><a href=\"/forum/community/api/Achievement-API-bugs/5859556\">Malediktus.9250:</a></cite></div><div class=\"quotey\"><p>Repeatable achievements not working properly</p></div></blockquote>\n<p>They’re working kind of properly, the API just doesn’t expose enough data for applications to make sense of it (oversight on my part). The proposed fix for this is <a href=\"https://github.com/arenanet/api-cdi/pull/142\">here</a>.</p>\n<blockquote><div class=\"citey\"><cite title=\"Posted on December 16 2015 05:54PM\"><a href=\"/forum/community/api/Achievement-API-bugs/5859556\">Malediktus.9250:</a></cite></div><div class=\"quotey\"><p>I think most of the missing achievements are achievements which are invisible until you reached at least 1 goal of it.</p></div></blockquote>\n<p>Yep, that’s exactly it.
