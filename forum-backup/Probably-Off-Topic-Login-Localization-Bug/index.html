<p>I guess this is pretty much off-topic but as Lawton is “the web guy” he probably has some details on this (if not: Sorry! And feel free to move this topic to the bug-board).</p>
<p>I think ANet somehow messed up the localization on the webservers.</p>
<p>Lately the launcher is acting very strange. I’m playing GW2 with the text-language set to german and audio-language set to english. Because of this, the login-form <strong>should</strong> be german but lately something strange is happening. When i start the launcher, the <strong>english</strong> form is displayed for a few seconds (2-3s) and then it gets swapped for the german form. Funny thing is: if i enter my username+password before the form is swapped out, instead of displaying the 2-factor form, it still just displays the german form and i have to enter my login-data again.</p>
<p>Pretty much since this is happening, I’m also getting a lot of errors after submitting my username+password that the login-servers could not be reached.</p>
<p>I talked to a few people and they are experiencing exactly the same problems.</p>
<p>So I’m wondering if ANet has changed the way the webservers handle the localized forms and messed something up while doing so…</p>
<p><strong>Edit</strong>: I added some screenshots which show that the Launcher is using german in the beginning, then switching to englisch and then switching to german again.</p></p>

<p>
<p>So, the launcher is implemented with web tech (it’s using <a href="http://coherent-labs.com/product-coherent-ui/">Coherent UI</a> under the covers) — but it’s loading HTML/CSS/Javascript from the .dat file rather than fetching it over the network (with the exception of the newsfeed which pull RSS down).</p>
<p>I’m thinking that maybe some bits on the native side might have changed in a subtle way — the language is stored in the local preferences (in gw2local.dat) which the web bits can’t read directly. Guessing that the ordering changed a bit or something else wonky happened since AFAIK we haven’t made any UI changes. I’ll ask around.</p></p>

<p>
<p>Thanks a lot! I’ll see if deleting local.dat and the caches changes anything. In the past this helped with some Coherent UI-stuff.</p></p>

<p>While you’re at it Lawton, if you can confirm if it is or not in relation with: <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/63d0nw/log_in_problems_when_using_shortcuts/">https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/63d0nw/log_in_problems_when_using_shortcuts/</a></p>

<p>
<p>Small Update: I tried some things to see if I could fix the delay (run defrag on the drive where GW2 is installed, deleted the local.dat, etc.) but nothing changed.</p></p>

<p>I honestly have no idea. The UI layer doesn’t have any responsibility whatsoever. I tried repro’ing it locally (assuming they’re using ‘-email xyz -password xyz -nopatchui’) with the live client but couldn’t get it to crash.</p>
<p>It’ll definitely crash when there’s an unfetched patch since ‘-nopatchui’ skips part of the patching process, but it’s been that way for years.</p></p>

<p>
<p>Oh, it’s not a crash. The window just stay empty and you have to ALT+F4 to try and relaunch.<br>
As this problem appeared approx. at the same time the other one pointed by OP, i wonder if they are linked.</p>
<p>My usual arguments are: -email x@y.z -password pw -nopatchui -shareArchive -32 -clientport:80 -maploadinfo</p>
<p>It happens quite randomly, but every time i tested without -shareArchive, it worked flawlessly.<br>
EDIT: finally, i had one empty window case with only “-email -password -nopatchui”</p></p>

<p>
<p>I forgot to come back here…<br>
So, the 2 problems were, it seems, unrelated.<br>
And the one I described is fixed since the day someone pointed an auth server was done, and an official (don’t remember who) said it was a long time, everything should be ok etc. but since that moment, never had the white/black screen anymore.<br>
Case closed.</p></p>

<p>Btw. the issue that the login-form is english for a few seconds before switching to the localized version is still a thing.</p></p>
