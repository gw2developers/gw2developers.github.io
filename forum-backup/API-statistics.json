The current WvW game state is just served from a centralized in-memory cache that’s updated as events come in from the map instance servers. We use this model for pretty much all API endpoints. This decouples API load from the game servers, but means that when we want to add new stuff to the API it means threading data through multiple components.</p>","arenanet":true},{"pubDate":"2015-09-16T19:04:12.000Z","guid":"http://forum-en.guildwars2.com/forum/community/api/API-statistics/5498769","author":"Dreamslayer.7659","body":"\n<blockquote><div class=\"citey\"><cite title=\"Posted on September 16 2015 06:53PM\"><a href=\"/forum/community/api/API-statistics/5498748\">Sariel V.7024:</a></cite></div><div class=\"quotey\"><p>I’m sure this is only going to get worse as time goes on.
