Namely, the ability to answer the following questions:</p>\n<ul>\n\t<li>Has $ckittene $dungeon story, and thus can open explorable mode?</li>\n\t<li>Has Account done $dungeon $path, or is it left to do for Dungeon Master?</li>\n\t<li>How many times has Account done $dungeon $path since reset?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>These are all things that can help inform your gameplay. It’s annoying to discover that you can’t open the dungeon for the group at the last second, since you haven’t done story on that character. Similarly, knowing what you have left for Dungeon Master can be a godsend when you just see that you’re at 4/5 on Arah…. but haven’t run a path in months.
