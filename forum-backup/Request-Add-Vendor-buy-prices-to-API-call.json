Another interesting vendor is the one available with the <a href=\"https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Tarrktun_Personal_Delivery_Portal\">Tarrktun Personal Delivery Portal</a> which is player-accessible, but not via NPC (when you use the portal there are bulk quantities unavailable from the NPC vendor).</p>\n<p>Anyway, it’s really tricky to get right, and because of that it’s a few notches lower priority in my backlog.
