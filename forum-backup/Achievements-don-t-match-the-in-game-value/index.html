<p>
<p>Hello now I’m at API:2/achievements. I’m making a list of all achievements taking them from API:2/achievements/groups then from API:2/achievements/categories, for a total of 1914 achievements and 18.564 AP. I hope that these calculated values are the right ones.<br>
So to calculate the unlocked amount of AP, I use API:2/account/achievements and I compare it with API:2/achievements; so at the end I get 15.338 AP plus 15.000 from daily&amp;monthly = 30.338 AP.<br>
In reality in game I have 30.340 AP, so there are 2 AP missing somewhere XD<br>
I’m quite sure that “General” or “Historical” group have something missing/wrong. For the other groups I have calculated the amount of AP manually and the results are the same taken from my app, but for the two groups above I’m becoming mad.<br>
I have updated the app to get the achievements from API:2/account/achievements that are not in any API:2/achievements/categories and the result is the following list of ids=428,1917,780,883,890,1210,1348,1347,1343,1684,3046,130,104,647,915<br>
Seems that almost all of them are old/daily achievements (it’s what I think) but ids=1684,3046 don’t exist, so I don’t even know if they are something important or not.</p>
<p>p.s.: I’m using data directly from API and not old stored data on pc, so comparisons with other sites/app could return to different results, but I have already checked some and are even wrong in other ways.</p></p>

<p>Woot, thanks for the ids — that made it super easy.</p>
<p>Went ahead and whitelisted both of those achievements.</p></p>

<p>Well there are the following ids = 79342,79320,79322,79319 that are missing as API:2/Items for the achievement id 3089</p></p>

<p>Blergh, not sure why whitelisting that achievement didn’t also whitelist the items. Whitelisted the manually while I try to figure out why that isn’t working.</p></p>

<p>A lot of people seem to have 1 AP more than the API can verify. But so far noone found out the solution.</p></p>

<p>
<p>Here we go again!<img src="/include/images/smilies/colondee.png"><br>
Lawton I think I have found the last bugs from API:2/achievements.</p>
<p>Achievement id=2030 “For the Children!” has the title id=214 as reward that is missing in API:2/titles.</p>
<p>Achievement id=2049 “Grawnk Munch” has the title id=216 as reward that is missing in API:2/titles.</p>
<p>Achievement id=2562 “Line of Fire” has “bits”:[{"type":“Text”,“text”:“Ally: Canach”},{"type":“Text”,“text”:“Ally: Caithe”},{"type":“Text”,“text”:“Ally: Braham”}] in API:2/achievements, but from API:2/account/achievements I get {"id":2562,<a href="1">current</a>,<a href="1">max</a>,<a href="true}">done</a>. With all the other achievements that have “bits” object, API:2/account/achievements returns a “bits” object with unlocked things if done=false, while it returns an empty object “bits”=[] if done=true.<br>
Well achievement id=2562 in API:2/account/achievements misses that object “bits”=[]. Actually I don’t know if there are other achievements with more bits that requires only one to complete, anyway this achievement seems to be a special case.<br>
I could avoid this “bug” checking everytimes if “bits” object is null or not, but I know that everytimes there are bits in API:2/achievements there must exist the same object in API:2/account/achievements.</p></p>

<p>I dont think so. I have 33.390 both in gw2efficiency and if I do the manual work of adding up all my achievements manually. Ingame I do have 33.391, so there must be a super hidden achievement somewhere.</p>
<p>I suspect it might be from an hidden infinite achievement that existed at release. It required you to transmute items and it was infinite. Before Anet removed it I had about 3k ap from it. Maybe it was resetted to 1 Ap instead of 0?</p></p>

<p>Can you link an api key with progression, for few hours, so I can check if there are some achievements in you account that are missing in API:2/achievements? <br>
Anyway all removed achievements should count as 0.</p></p>

<p>Lawton in addition to the last 3 bugs written in a reply above, I have found that in category id=33 “Flame and Frost”, in Historical group, there is the strange achievement “Minor in Achievement” id=561, while in category id=22 “Super Adventure Box: World 1” there is another achievement “Minor in Achievement” but with id=863.<br>
So the second achievement is surely right, but the first one with id=561 maybe shouldn’t even exist.</p>
<p>Another thing that I don’t know if is right or not is that some achievements with lot of bits as text (like some explorer achievements) have some bits as text but empty text value for a total amount of objectives that is more than in game value.</p></p>

<p>The one in Flame and Frost category is only for accounts who have not logged in since SAB was around first time (and completed the SAB meta achievement). Later a reward was added to the meta achievement and this is a placeholder one. It probably should be blacklisted since it gets converted to the new achievement as soon as you log in.</p>
<p>Also pmed you my api key.</p></p>

<p>Ok Malediktus.3740 I have checked your achievements and the id=1257 is an achievement that is missing in API:2/achievements.</p>

<p>maybe it is that one, but it must be one that is hidden ingame, too. I crosschecked gw2efficiency, ingame and wiki already.</p></p>

<p>After more than 2 months bugs are still here -_-</p>
<p>Title ids=214,216 are missing and I’m not sure that there aren’t other missing titles in API:2/Title so when you can please check them all.</p>
<p>Achievements id=2562 returns “bits”:[{"type":“Text”,“text”:“Ally: Canach”},{"type":“Text”,“text”:“Ally: Caithe”},{"type":“Text”,“text”:“Ally: Braham”}] , but now I have noticed that these bits are of another achievement, so for the id=2562 “bits” should be null.<br>
Achievement id =1257 is still missing as I have read from other posts on the forum.</p></p>

<p>214 = The Magnanimous; it’s awarded via achievement so I’m not entirely sure why that’s not coming through (<a href="https://api.guildwars2.com/v2/achievements/2030">https://api.guildwars2.com/v2/achievements/2030</a>).<br>

<p>Blergh, that’s super annoying. Those bits <strong>are</strong> associated with the achievement, they’re just not referenced from the achievement tracking part. Will have to add some stuff to filter those out. <a href="https://github.com/arenanet/api-cdi/issues/402">Tracking issue</a>.</p>

<p>That’s a bugged achievement — need to look into whether it is actually counted towards total AP. Empirically I’ve heard that it doesn’t. Debating on whether to whitelist it on /v2/achievements or to blacklist it from /v2/account/achievements.</p></p>

<p>Some months ago I checked all AP of Malediktus.3740 and I noticed that only achievement id=1257 is missing and from what Malediktus.3740 himself said between API data and game value there is only 1 AP less.</p>
<p>So, in my opinion, there are three ways:<br>
1* the achievement 1257 counts as 1AP<br>
2* there is another missing achievement that counts as 1AP (I don’t think so)<br>
3* in game value is wrong (Can it be possible!?!)</p></p>

<p>I went ahead and whitelisted 1257 — though the data I’m looking at shows it’s worth 5AP. I don’t think it’s the source of the 1AP discrepancy.</p>
<p>Any other missing achievements would show up in /v2/account/achievements, so I don’t think it’s that. It could be something weird with the daily/monthly counts (an off-by-one somewhere in the API code?). Not really sure.</p>
<p>I don’t think the in-game value is wrong though; IIRC someone went through all their achievements and added them up by hand to verify that the in-game value is correct and the API data is wrong. Just haven’t figured out where exactly the error is coming from.</p></p>

<p>It was me who manually added up everything.</p>
<p>I lost hope that the 1 AP discrepancy can be solved with reasonable effort anymore, but I located more people who have 1 AP more than they can find by manually adding up everything, all veteran accounts. So it is probably either some ancient relic achievement or some kind of overflow/calculation error somewhere.<br>
My newer accounts do not have this 1 AP out of nowhere.</p></p>
