I saw that the version 1 became obsolete due to the MegaServer implementation. I was wondering when would this get re-introduced? I was planning on programming an app that would tell the users what events are active on what maps so they could be able to quickly go to them. I was also going to make this app as a helpful tool for commanders that wants to lead others on current events.</p>","arenanet":false}]}
