As useful as it might be to be able to type in a guild name and have it return rudimentary information about the guild it would be more useful and more in-depth to allow guilds to dynamically display their member lists/ranks on their sites.</p>\n<p>Even more in-depth would be to add a boolean to allow for the request to show information on whether or not a member was representing at the current time or even online.  Although after the member list is compiled through the guild server then allowing the program to search for online status within a player server would be simple enough.</p>\n<p>Please post any thoughts or ideas.</p>","arenanet":false}]}
