<p>I tried incorporating some mystic forge recipes (i.e. the upgrades) into the mix and feed it into my minimum acquisition routine and came up with some interesting results.</p>
<p>Here is the crafting cost for the Rampager’s Destroyer Shield output by a small console program I developed to test my lib.</p>
<p>It recommends crafting with a cost of 15g 75s 20c.  If I check the same shield in gw2spidy I have a crafting cost of 17g 96s 91c.  Granted that spidy’s data maybe a little more outdated since my program gets data directly from the trading post, but the inclusion of the mystic forge recipes helped to find a cheaper path towards crafting than I would have had without it.</p>
<p>I am still working on it and there may be some bugs in my code at the moment, but at the cost of a few skill points, which my code hasn’t calculated those yet, I could have saved myself about 2g.</p>
<p>This is using the data provided by gw2db at the moment as the items api is still not complete and doesn’t supply me the vendor costs right now.  I also gave an average estimate of 21 crystalline dusts from upgrading 250 incandescent dusts.</p></p>

<p>
<p>Here is another one.  How much is it to craft a Jormag’s Needle?  Gw2spidy wouldn’t give you an answer, but you can craft one for about 79g giving you a profit of about 40g (after tp taxes), for the price of some skill points, of course.</p></p>

<p>
<p>Your Recipe for Jormag’s needle looks a little off.  I’d had the bad recipe too until recently, so I suspect we have similar sources for the data.</p>
<p>There’s also more than one way to make it, although I will grant you the second method includes a bit of random and burns a few more skill points.<br>

<p>
<p>Yes there are actually 2 recipes for this one and I just so happened to dump the first one which gives the more profitable result.  I got both recipes from the wiki.</p>
<p>Here is the second one with the corrupted cores.  Currently I assume 21 crystalline dust to be produced by upgrading incandescent dust (looks like you assumed 25 instead?) so the calculation averages out but there maybe a small rounding error.</p></p>

<p>The recipe with destroyer/molten lodestones is for Titans’ Vengance, not Jormag’s Needle.</p></p>

<p>Thanks, you are right, looks like they have updated that information on the wiki.</p>
<p>Titans’ Vengance recipe used to be 50 mystic coins, 100 Orichalcum sword blades, 50 corrupted lodestones and 1 eldritch scroll but I guess that was wrong info on the wiki then.</p>
<p>In any case, I made provisions in my code for one item to have multiple recipes.  I only need to update my JSON script.</p></p>

<p>The wiki often starts with a mix of right and wrong info…   In any case, the big challenge I faced was identifying the cheapest way to make something, when ‘cheap’ is subject to how someone defines it.  I’ve got skill points and karma to burn, I’ve got a friend with neither.  We both look have different choices for ‘cheapest way to craft’.<br>

<p>It assumes minimum cost based on gold as that is the most natural way of expressing this to the user and I believe this is how gw2spidy treats karma too.</p>
<p>Alternatively, we can have the user supply a conversion rate but that gets complicated and I don’t think that would matter much to the results in most cases.</p></p>

<p>
<p>I agree with your statements:</p>
<ul>
	<li>as far as the app is concerned, it just outputs whatever karma or skill points cost it would take.</li>
	<li>the user decides their worth.</li>
</ul>
<p>There is fine print that I find I’ll have to remain vague on, and any disagreement we might have will come from that fine print.  If you use your tool to try and make money in the market, you may see some of this fine print.</p>
<p>Or message me directly.</p>

<p>Yes I certainly see your point.  Is the cost of 127 skill points worth a 37g profit?  Maybe or maybe not.  It depends on the player, but I think with time, many characters are going to accumulate lots of skill points as they level up even at level 80.  So what are they going to do with all those skill points?  In the end, we would still leave it to the users to decide for themselves if it is worth it or not.</p></p>
