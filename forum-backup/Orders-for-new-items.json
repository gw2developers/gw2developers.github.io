I am having trouble understanding how the items released in today’s update have buy orders, when they are not valid ID’s (don’t show on v2/items, but have listings orders on commerce/listings/XXXX).</p>\n<p>For those items in the old times (like 31130), I know that we could place orders for items yet to be released and now despite being in the listings list they do not have buy/sell orders, but I thought that it had been fixed. So how can there be buying orders for items that does not exist in the game and have been released hours ago like 69231, 69451, 69469?</p>\n<p>Thank you for the help,<br>\nHappy programming.</p>","arenanet":false}]}
