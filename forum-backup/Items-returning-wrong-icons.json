This might not be as simple as I’d assumed — take, for example, <a href=\"https://api.guildwars2.com/v2/items/29185\">Dusk</a> and <a href=\"https://api.guildwars2.com/v2/items/31087\">Naegling</a> which share the same skin — their item icons take precedence over their skin icons (specifically, Naegling’s icon appears to override its skin’s icon). I’m guessing there’s a flag that we’re not checking which toggles the override behavior.</p>\n<p>EDIT: eh, nevermind, the icon for Naegling should be the same as Dusks; just an instance where the wiki is returning bad data from the API.</p>","arenanet":true},{"pubDate":"2015-01-22T18:51:07.000Z","guid":"http://forum-en.guildwars2.com/forum/community/api/Items-returning-wrong-icons/4717099","author":"Lawton Campbell.8517","body":"\n<p>Whoops, yeah, that’s a bug. Apparently the item has a different icon than it’s default skin, which is unusual. The API code is wrongly making the item’s icon have priority over the skin’s icon — not sure when the fix will land but you can work around it in the meanwhile by pulling the default skin’s icon instead (e.g.,<a href=\"https://api.guildwars2.com/v2/skins/5605\">/v2/skins/5605</a>).</p>","arenanet":true},{"pubDate":"2015-01-22T15:07:20.000Z","guid":"http://forum-en.guildwars2.com/forum/community/api/Items-returning-wrong-icons/4716452","author":"Sariel V.7024","body":"\n<p>For the most part I suspect this is working, but I had an example this morning where the API icon did not match the one used in-game. <br>\n Case in point, Glorious Hero’s Pauldrons.
