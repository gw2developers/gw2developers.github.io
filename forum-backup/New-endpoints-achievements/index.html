<p>
<p>Turned on a pair of new endpoints today:</p>
<ul>
	<li><a href="https://api.guildwars2.com/v2/achievements?page=0">/v2/achievements</a> — a bulk-expanded endpoint for retrieving achievement metadata, and</li>
	<li><a href="https://api.guildwars2.com/v2/account/achievements?access_token=7CEA47F8-3970-044C-9FCE-402C1949987748D89AE3-1A8C-4323-BB0A-98979DE5B7DC">/v2/account/achievements</a> — for getting an account’s achievement progress.</li>
</ul>
<p>The latter requires the new “progression” API key scope (sorry!).</p>
<p>We’ll be making some additions to the /v2/achievements output in the future — right now we’re missing details about collection achievements, rewards for all achievements (including AP), and the per-bit strings for getting better information about the player’s progress (e.g., which dungeons you’ve completed for dungeon master).</p>

<p>I found a bug in the Slayer achievements (ids = 1,3,4,5,6,7,8,13,16,23,24,25,26,27,28,30,31,32,33,34,36,38,39,40,41,43,44,45,46,47,48,50,51,52)</p>

<p>
<p>It appears that many other achievements have the same issue – not just with the counter but the <em>done</em> flag as well. Although, that flag might just be comparing <em>current</em> to <em>max</em>.</p>
<p>The <em>current</em> field is always stuck on either 1 (Slayer, Weaponmaster, PvP Titles) or 0 (Explorer, Dive Master, Treasure Hunter, etc.)</p>
<p>Some additional, potentially useful info:<br>
Many of achievements which are stuck at <em>current</em>=1 actually should be completed. Is the <em>current</em> field being written to instead of <em>done</em>? For example, my completed Slayer achievements appear to have a count of 1 (instead of 1000) while the incomplete ones have the actual kill count.</p></p>

<p>Nice, /v2/achievements used to lead to broken dailies.<br>
Is there an easy way to check today’s dailies? Would be a nice site or app.</p></p>

<p>Looks like my implementation neglected to take into account that counter-type achievements change their storage type when you complete them — the counter gets erased and it’s stored as a bitflag instead. I’m going to try to get this fix out for the next patch and add some more unit tests ;_;.</p>
<p>The done flag definitely just checks current &gt;= max, though, so if the counter value is broken then the done flag will be too.</p>

<p>It’s something that’s being worked on; there’s a beta endpoint up at /v2/achievements/daily but it does not behave well w.r.t reset (e.g., it doesn’t flip over when the game does). Probably going to change that endpoint up a bit; there’s some discussion about it in <a href="https://github.com/arenanet/api-cdi/pull/96">the github thread</a>.</p></p>

<p>
<p>To add to some of the bugs already named (done field and current counter):</p>
<p>- Achievements with the Type “ItemSet” dont seem to track completion (e.g. I unlocked the luminescent achievements, but they dont even show up in the account api)<br>
- Some achievements have weird max values (“-1”), e.g. the “slayer” achievement in pvp. Are these the one’s that are counting forever? Problem with that is that we cant show what the max ingame is (in that case 2000)</p>
<p>{<br>
      “id”: 239,<br>
      “current”: 9408,<br>
      “max”: -1,<br>
      “done”: false<br>
    }</p>
<p>Even tho you guys probably have all that stuff on your todo lists, here is a list of things I would LOVE for this endpoint:</p>
<p>- Getting “max” value for the unauthorized achievement endpoint as well. I didnt start kegmaster, so I dont know how many “requirements” i need<br>
- Show the requirements,  (needed achievements, items, …). Also “text” objectives like for “Powered up” (<a href="http://i.imgur.com/7SWQ7Bb.png">http://i.imgur.com/7SWQ7Bb.png</a>). Without this we can’t really make use of the bits.<br>
- Show the rewards (AP, items, titles, mastery points, …)<br>
- Show the category of the achievement (Heart of Thorns -&gt; Verdant Brink)</p>
<p>Edit: I should read more closely. Still gonna leave the list here, even tho it is in the original post.<img src="/include/images/smilies/smile.png"></p></p>

<p>I’m … actually not sure why those bits aren’t coming out. I’ll look into that today and hopefully have a fix out for the Dec. 1st release. Thanks for pointing that out.</p>

<p>I think those are using the achievement tiers as counters (since it’s the same counter used across multiple achievements, it doesn’t cap). We’ll have those bits exposed on Dec 1st as well.</p>

<p>That part should be in on Nov. 17th, the rest of the feature requests on Dec. 1st (though I reserve the right to slip on those dates — the backend for the achievement stuff is painfully complex).</p></p>

<p>The entire distribution needs a gigantic overhaul and a massive expansion. Time gated content taking up 50% of available achievements isn’t healthy.</p></p>

<p>Thank you for the fixes Lawton, the achievements with counter issues seem to be resolved.</p>
<p>I still want to report that some achievements are not being tracked correctly. For example, the Master specialization achievements:[2385,2448,2471,2353,2384,2395,2455,2593]</p>
<p>The completed ones show up as current=0. The ones that are not completed do not get returned at all in the “/account/achievements” query.</p></p>

<p>The bug I listed in the above post is still present. Is this something that’s on the radar?</p></p>

<p>I have a question I’m hoping someone could answer. I think I already know the answer but I’m not 100%. So right now the achievement response specific to say…id=880 would be:</p>
<p>{"requirement": “Meet up with Rox in Sparkfly Fen.”, “description”: "", “flags”: [], “type”: “Default”, “id”: 880, “name”: “She’s Over Here!”}</p>
<p>If I wanted to filter out all unobtainable achievements, I’m pretty sure there’s no way of doing that without going in manually. Is there any chance this will be added in the future or am I missing something?</p></p>

<p>I just turned on <a href="https://api.guildwars2.com/v2/achievements/groups?ids=all">/v2/achievements/groups</a> and <a href="https://api.guildwars2.com/v2/achievements/categories?ids=all">/v2/achievements/categories</a> which provide the information that’s used to display achievements in the UI. With that, you should be able to filter out everything that’s not displayed in the UI (though … I think all of the achievements <strong>are</strong> in there somewhere). Those endpoints should make it a bit more straightforward to make sense of all the achievements.</p></p>

<p>Okay, so looks like there’s another class of achievements that I’ve missed. Most of the achievements that use counters change their storage class when you reach the max — instead of storing the count, they just become a bitfield. The ones that don’t use the individual tiers (which we don’t currently expose — probably should rig that up) to determine completion.</p>
<p>Long story short: not sure I’ll have this one fixed before the next patch. Might be able to get a bandaid fix that has some effects; we’ll see.</p></p>

<p>The bandaid fix was less horrible than I imagined (there were fewer mishandled achievements than I expected), so I went ahead and pushed it out. Lemmie know if you find any other madness that I’ve missed <img src="/include/images/smilies/lion.png"></p></p>

<p>Just noticed, that achievements are missing. More specifically, I can’t seem to find the Legendary Crafting II and III one’s. Am I looking wrong?<img src="/include/images/smilies/deecolon.png"></p></p>

<p>
<p>I <strong>think</strong> there’s some achievements that are flagged as “hidden” that are intentionally being skipped since that flag is also used to indicate achievements that can’t be acquired in-game and shouldn’t be displayed in the UI. I know there’s one or two in the EotM achievements; I didn’t realize it also included Legendary Crafting O_O.</p></p>

<p>
<p>Some achievements are hidden until you unlocked them by achieving them or unlocking a prequesite achievement. Like if you complete Legendary Precursor Crafting 1 it will unlock the 2nd, then the 3rd etc.</p>
<p>Also am I missing something or does the API also do not show achievements like<br>
Group Effort I, Group Effort II, Group Effort III, Group Effort IV, Group Effort V<br>
Lunatic Inquisition Regular and probably some more, I did not check all.<br>
They are repeatable achievements in the historical section.</p></p>

<p>Bleh, thanks for the report, I didn’t think to check that with Wintersday. Probably won’t have it fixed until the next festival. Made a <a href="https://github.com/arenanet/api-cdi/issues/162">Github issue</a> to track the bug.</p></p>
