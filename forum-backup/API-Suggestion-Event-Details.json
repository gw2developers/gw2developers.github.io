With the current approach, in JavaScript, and probably any dynamic language that can map as easily to JSON, everything works <em>immediately</em> and that’s great for JS applications. However, as a rule, static languages have a much easier time processing an array allowing you to explicitly look up the values of the keys you expect to be there. The reasoning that this data is great for maps/dictionaries is completely sound, it’s just that building that dictionary is a lot more work right now if you’re not using JS and literally no work at all if you are. In contrast the alternative would require the same, small amount of work for <em>all</em> languages, including JS, which, of course, is a minor inconvenience for such applications.</p>\n<p>I would definitely change this back for an eventual v2 since building your own dictionary from an array is guaranteed trivial in any language with dictionary support, despite the consequence of a needless (but completely negligible) overhead for JS.</p>","arenanet":false},{"pubDate":"2013-06-27T19:25:55.000Z","guid":"http://forum-en.guildwars2.com/forum/community/api/API-Suggestion-Event-Details/2303123","author":"ozma.3498","body":"\n<p>A couple of requests:</p>\n<p>In event_details.json, it would be good to have details on the time between an event being completed and it starting again (including whether or not it is based on its own completion or that of another event – for example, meta events).

If it would be like this, it would maybe make (a little) sense, but it’s not the case. There is no event_id argument passable into events_details API. You have to fetch everything and thus event_details is more like “one-time get all event informations and cache it” API. And that’s the argument for my initial post – the API should be the same as event_names. There’s no reason to have dynamic key names in JSON, that’s just miles far away from JSON best practices.</p>\n<p>Many libraries for JSON parsing in .NET (RestSharp, JSON.NET) and Java can handle what you say automatically without custom parsers when the JSON API is standardized (my suggested image from post above) and you’ll have an dictionary with &lt;eventID, event&gt; created automatically by those libraries … dynamic keys just makes everything harder to parse, in .NET for example your simplest solution is to use &lt;dynamic&gt; (e.g. var events = RestClient.Execute&lt;dynamic&gt;(new RestRequest(“event_details.json”)).Data[“events”];), but it’s just not that pretty as automatic deserialization into your own POJOs/POCOs.</p>\n<p>ANet, please get rid of dynamic keys in (some of) your JSON APIs.</p>","arenanet":false},{"pubDate":"2013-06-26T12:47:31.000Z","guid":"http://forum-en.guildwars2.com/forum/community/api/API-Suggestion-Event-Details/2291552","author":"Healix.5819","body":"\n<blockquote><div class=\"citey\"><cite title=\"Posted on June 25 2013 11:40AM\"><a href=\"/forum/community/api/API-Suggestion-Event-Details/2279029\">Eremko.6950:</a></cite></div><div class=\"quotey\"><p>Is it just me or do you also see the inconsistency in Event Details API?</p></div></blockquote>\n<p>Some people were complaining about how the events were just in a simple array and wanted them to be referenced by the key instead.
