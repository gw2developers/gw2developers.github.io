For example the Chamber of Ministers landmark (id 265) in the Divinity’s Reach is not available in floor 1 but, it is in floor 2.<br>\nSo, i’d like to know if there’s a way to ask for all pois of a map independently of the floor level ?  Or if there’s a way to add this to the API ?<br>\nMy english is a little rusty so I hope I’m still understandable.<br>\nBest regards !</p>\n<p>Edit : Nevermind, i found thae answer with <a href=\"https://api.guildwars2.com/v2/continents/1/floors?ids=all\">https://api.guildwars2.com/v2/continents/1/floors?ids=all</a> ^^</p>","arenanet":false}]}
