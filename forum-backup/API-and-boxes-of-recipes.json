At the moment, there are items in game (such as the <a href=\"http://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Box_of_Recipes:_The_Ravenswood_Staff\">Box of Recipes: The Ravenswood Staff</a>) which are recipe ‘sheets’ used to unlock multiple recipes at once. This one in particular will unlock 3 items. The problem here though is that if you look at the “API entry” for the box of recipes it only shows one recipe id instead of 3.</p>\n<p>The shown recipe id in this case refers to the one used for the Ravenswood Staff. It seems like the general rule in the API will be that only the ‘primary’ recipe is shown and the other ones are just lost.</p>\n<p>For reference, the recipe id for <a href=\"http://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Jar_of_Luminesce_Polish\">Jar of Luminesce Polish</a> is <a href=\"https://api.guildwars2.com/v2/recipes?id=10296\">10296</a>, an entry which is not referenced at all in the recipe item page.</p>\n<p>I’ve gone through most (if not all) the recipe pages and not found a reference to such ‘secondary’ items.</p>\n<p>I’m certain this isn’t a high priority to get sorted out, but is there in the mean time a way to figure out what all the items unlocked by a recipe box are, or is this simply not possible with the current system?</p>\n<p>If I’ve just missed something evident, I would be more than happy to have it pointed out to me.</p>","arenanet":false}]}
