As i mentioned in the post right above yours, i was intending to go exactly what that api would provide through hours of manual exploration and discovery before providing it as a 3rd party api of my own. I would appreciate it not to waste so many hours i could have spent another way, only to be slapped in the face by a shiny new api a day after i am done. I fondly remember that day where i finally got my code running properly for the v1/item_details api that took about 6-9 hours (because i was so kind not to violate the api with 1 billion request simultaniously and instead only used 4 threads for that) to draw in all items that existed at the time in all 4 available language, and literally the next day you smacked me with the much faster v2/items apis.
