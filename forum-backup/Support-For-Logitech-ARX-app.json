Are there any plans to support in-game stat display for the Logitech ARX app?  The app interfaces with the new Logitech G910 Orion Spark keyboard and, at least theoretically, can display in-game information.  I really liked the GW2 LCD applet for the G19 keyboard and was disappointed to not have anything like it with the ARX app/G910 keyboard.  Not asking for dates, or anything like that…just like to know if there is any interest on ANet’s part to support ARX.  Thanks.</p>","arenanet":false}]}
