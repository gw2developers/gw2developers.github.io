Currently on our maps we are able to see a lot of orange dot positions and movements, any plans to make this available in the API? I understand that this probably isn’t there for at least two reasons: 1) potentially unfair, 2) it’s more or less real-time data and would result in thrashing the API servers. Can’t hurt to ask though :]</p>\n<p>I ask about damage/supply/siege information as it might be useful in terms of knowing how crucial it is for a float team to change map in order to defend valuable assets, rather than relying on bad scout reports in teamchat.</p>\n<p>Anything else you guys can think of that’d be cool to be able to scrape about live matchups?</p>","arenanet":false}]}
