But what i would really like to see is being able to use the API key, to list all your characters, showing gear, role, specialization and so on. Then being able to choose one of them from a drop downlist and assign it to a listed raid run within your guild.</p>\n<p>Atm, i spend a kittenload of time on updating, and making my google spreadsheets more practical and easy to use for my members, but being able to do the same thing with the API key would make it so much easiere for ALOT of members.</p>\n<p>What if your thought about this?</p>","arenanet":false}]}
