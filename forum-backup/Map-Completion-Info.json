Lots of guilds do map completion events where they take as many guild members as are interested in 100% complete a map. The prerequisite of course is choosing which map to complete. With a lot of people with different map completions it would be very useful to be able to pull map completion information.</p>\n<p>Just another use case to add to back up the request; I understand there’s probably more important things going on with Path of Fire and whatnot but a map completion API would be outstanding to see.</p>","arenanet":false},{"pubDate":"2015-11-10T22:15:06.000Z","guid":"http://forum-en.guildwars2.com/forum/community/api/Map-Completion-Info/5745208","author":"rodadams.5963","body":"\n<p>:-(<br>\n:-(<br>\n:-(</p>","arenanet":false},{"pubDate":"2015-11-09T18:32:33.000Z","guid":"http://forum-en.guildwars2.com/forum/community/api/Map-Completion-Info/5740275","author":"Lawton Campbell.8517","body":"\n<p>Pretty far down on the list <img src=\"/include/images/smilies/sad.png\"></p>\n<p>That data’s pretty complex to extract, unfortunately.</p>","arenanet":true},{"pubDate":"2015-11-07T20:15:56.000Z","guid":"http://forum-en.guildwars2.com/forum/community/api/Map-Completion-Info/5732908","author":"rodadams.5963","body":"\n<p>I was wondering where on the list getting per character map completion information is?</p>\n<p>With several new zones to explore, and a plethorea of characters to explore them with, it’s quite difficult to track who has been where.
