<p>
<p>This is a question/suggestion for users designing applications/sites.</p>
<p>At the moment we have plenty of sites with a timer that shows which metaevents are available on a range of servers.</p>
<p>Is it possible to design a system where on one single page, you will be able to see the metaevents on three servers at once?</p>
<p>At the moment, I just use gw2stuff.com and open three tabs, one for each server. But it can get quite clunky having so many tabs and it’s just not efficient.</p>
<p>This site would be good for hardcore players, so bells &amp; whistles with maps and graphics aren’t all that important. Most hardcore players know where these events are and would just prefer an easy to use website.</p>
<p>My suggestion would be to have three drop down menus, and from these menus, you can choose a server. Below these menus you will see the active metaevents. Even better if you’d be able to design an overlay with this information packed neatly in a corner!</p></p>

<p>Here’s a quick one I just made.</p>
<p>Download the txt file or copy the raw paste data from <a href="http://pastebin.com/EQ3vx3Ri">http://pastebin.com/EQ3vx3Ri</a> and save it as a file with a “.htm” extension. Open it in a web browser to view it. If using IE, you’ll need to click through the “allow blocked content” popup, which disables javascript from running when viewing local files.</p>
<p>Or, demo it <a href="http://jsfiddle.net/TfVAa/1/embedded/result/">http://jsfiddle.net/TfVAa/1/embedded/result/</a>.</p></p>

<p>I like the multi, its not a big deal to switch and see other servers but seeing several on one page is handy. Since we are bound to 3 servers max, its nice to be able to catch our favorite events if we missed them on server a and b. Makes it easier to be a casual player with less time on hand ^^</p></p>

<p>Dude Healix – that’s awesome! Didn’t know you could come up with something like that so quick!</p>
<p>Bookmarked and I will be using it from now on</p>
<p>Question – how difficult would it be to utilize gw2stuff’s overlay feature with this?</p></p>

<p>Another request from me!</p>
<p>Similar to the above, but using the event tracker</p>
<p>I’d like to keep an eye on available events on other servers so I can farm ;p</p></p>

<p>They modified the site to counter what the simple page did – display multiple webpages in separate frames. Not sure why they did it, since you can still rip the data directly from them.</p>
<p>For now, I made a workaround that basically caches gw2stuff as it’s seen right now. Any modifications made to the data will of course break it. This webpage must be downloaded and used from your local computer through Internet Explorer, since doing so allows you to bypass the limits on web requests, allowing you to make cross site requests.</p>
<p>You can download it here: <a href="https://docs.google.com/file/d/0BzK8l0-EXm-ZclJ2dFBuMEVyRjQ/edit?usp=sharing">https://docs.google.com/file/d/0BzK8l0-EXm-ZclJ2dFBuMEVyRjQ/edit?usp=sharing</a></p>
<p>Extract it and open multi.htm in Internet Explorer. Internet Explorer should have a popup saying something about Active X controls. Click allow blocked content. This message appears because javascript is disabled by default when opening a file from your local computer.</p></p>

<p>So is this any different than just opening 3 tabs and having 3 servers then? I really liked being more efficient with my time in game lol..</p></p>

<p>Basically, it’s the same thing as opening 3 windows and positioning them on top of each other so you can see all 3 at once. The original jsfiddle example was just that, 1 or more of the pages in frames on top of each other. But since they disabled that ability, that’s no longer possible.</p>
<p>With the workaround, the difference is that it is a cache of the page (without map functionality) as it is right now, so if they change the look of gw2stuff tomorrow, the cache won’t change with it. If they completely change the way timers work though, the cache will no longer work, at which point I can just generated another cache. The only bonus, besides now having to open 3 windows, is that you’re not downloading everything 3 times, since all the extra stuff like images is part of the cache.</p></p>

<p>I see, was it just strain then that they were worried about? Just going off the reddit, I program a little but I don’t understand API much… The multi server thing was great because for casuals with maybe only 1-3 hours a day they could catch their favorite events, especially with alts. Also embedding on guild sites doesn’t seem to work right.</p></p>

<p>
<p>The change didn’t affect anyone viewing their page. You can still just open 3 browser windows for your 3 servers.</p>
<p>What they did was add a line of code into the page that prevents the timers from loading if the page is embedded within another page. Their reason was that someone was embedding their page and spam refreshing it, causing it to reload all the resources (scripts and images) over and over, which is a waste of bandwidth. The change however does not stop those resources from loading, just the timers, so if they’re still spamming, their still reloading all the scripts. The person probably stopped however, since there’s no point in loading empty timers.</p></p>
