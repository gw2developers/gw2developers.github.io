Simply use <strong>/v2/items?page=0&amp;page_size=200</strong> to fetch 200 items at once. You can read the X-Page-Total HTTP header to know how many other pages there are. Then you can fetch all 206 (currently) pages of items with threads and do what you need with them there. <strong>/v2/items?page=1&amp;page_size=200</strong> and so on.</p>","arenanet":false},{"pubDate":"2015-05-28T10:54:16.000Z","guid":"http://forum-en.guildwars2.com/forum/community/api/how-to-query-all-ids-at-once/5105512","author":"Dagins.5163","body":"\n<p>Hello, I would like to query all ids of items at once for market prices, but there is a limit of 200 per query.

I am thinking about doing it with threads, where each thread would query pack of 200 ids.</p>\n<p>What is the best way to do this?</p>\n<p>PS: I use Python.</p>","arenanet":false}]}
