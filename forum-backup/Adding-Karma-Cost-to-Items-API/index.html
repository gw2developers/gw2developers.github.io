<p>Hey guys,</p>
<p>Great work on letting the items from vendors (and elsewhere not before obtainable via API) begin to flow into the items API. My updater scripts have been pulling in new IDs all night.</p>
<p>Is it possible to add a karma cost as a field in your items API? I’d like to make a nice karma to gold tool :P</p>
<p>Sincerely,<br>
RebornGeek</p></p>

<p>A vendor API that displays the inventory, prices and location of vendors is definitely something discussed, but it’s a bit of a nightmare to implement. There’s a bunch of vendors that aren’t player-accessible and they’re not easily distinguished from normal vendors. Like that Skritt merchant in the Mad King’s Labyrinth whose inventory displayed the stocks of Halloween skins for the raffle.</p>
<p>It might be more feasible if we consider only heart vendors, but I’d have to look to see if they’re easily enumerated.</p>
<p>tl;dr it’s on the books but towards the back of the queue.</p></p>

<p>Yeah, uhh, I haven’t turned those bits on yet. They shouldn’t even be on live yet.</p>

<p>EDIT: Yeah, double-checked. They’re not on live yet. All’s right with the world.</p></p>

<p>Hmmm my mistake, either way my scripts observed new ids coming into the api like:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.gw2shinies.com/item/70222">https://www.gw2shinies.com/item/70222</a></p>
<p>A much higher item ID than what was previously stored. So naturally, I assumed you were green-lighting IDs that were once hidden.</p></p>

<p>I’m not sure why, but for a lot of items there appear to be duplicate item definitions? They appear to be effectively the same but have a different id. No idea why they exist, but players probably have them (since they pop up in my whitelist) so I normally push ’em through.</p>
<p>As a good example: the 1-year and 2-year level 20 birthday scrolls. They’re effectively the same item, but they don’t stack because they have a different id. &gt;_&lt;</p></p>

<p>A lot of people have noticed the same thing: stuff that seems like it should stack but doesn’t due to multiple IDs. Tons of people notice the birthday scrolls. Less talked about are the identically named champion bags, e.g. the wiki identifies over a dozen <em>exotic</em> versions of the <a href="http://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Fallen_Adventurer%27s_Backpack">Fallen Adventurer’s Backpack</a> (plus non-exotic varieties as well). It seems that they should have different names, if they point to different loot tables, or have the same item ID if they use the same tables.</p>
<p>There are similar examples for found gear versus vendor gear versus karma gear: same item name and different IDs, since each have different values of salvageable, tradeable, and salable.</p></p>

<p>Partially because the rules have changed? Some items were “account bound” others “account bound on acquire” and sometimes certain items auto-convert if you put them in your character inventory and swap maps (and then they stack<img src="/include/images/smilies/smile.png"> )</p>
<p>Speaking of karma cost — another bonus difficulty would be character-level specific price. In certain cases (weapon selling NPC in wvw, for example), cost of items is less if you are on character below level 80<img src="/include/images/smilies/smile.png"></p></p>

<p>I guess it’s certainly not your department but, could you pass it on and see if there’s any chance of a fix for that lol? Kinda silly having those scrolls take up two spaces.</p></p>

<p>There’s another type of scroll that looks identical but doesn’t stack, so I’ve got three stacks of these things in my bank.</p>
