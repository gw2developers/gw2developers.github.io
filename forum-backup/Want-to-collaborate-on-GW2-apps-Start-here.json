A central spot for all the API implementations sounds great for the central app page. I’m thinking I can list a collection of all API implementations/apps and filter by language; maybe even sort into categories eventually to separate purpose-built apps from tools and frameworks.</p>","arenanet":false},{"pubDate":"2013-05-22T13:18:29.000Z","guid":"http://forum-en.guildwars2.com/forum/community/api/Want-to-collaborate-on-GW2-apps-Start-here/2073064","author":"Gilosean.3805","body":"\n<p>Awesome.

It requires organizing users into teams and the organization would own any repos involved. I would rather everyone retain ownership of their respective projects. I don’t want friction to overshadow collaboration, which is the ultimate goal. I’m going to nix the Github organization for now so we can keep the repositories separate and just collaborate and manage each project in the Trello organization.</p>\n<p>That said, I do still want to create a page to show all of our apps in one place. For now, I’m just going to build a simple website and use the Github API to pull info on everyone’s repos.</p>","arenanet":false},{"pubDate":"2013-05-22T06:58:12.000Z","guid":"http://forum-en.guildwars2.com/forum/community/api/Want-to-collaborate-on-GW2-apps-Start-here/2071802","author":"Blumoon.5437","body":"\n<blockquote><div class=\"citey\"><cite title=\"Posted on May 21 2013 11:45PM\"><a href=\"/forum/community/api/Want-to-collaborate-on-GW2-apps-Start-here/2070447\">Cilio.4569:</a></cite></div><div class=\"quotey\"><p>I can help in android..

I was floored when the public API beta was released yesterday. I’ve been waiting since they first announced the would-be mobile apps. So, I decided to gauge interest on /r/Guildwars2 soon after the announcement and got a strong response from nearly 20 people who were interested in joining a collaborative effort to make awesome, open-source apps for Guild Wars 2. Now I see this forum bursting with cool ideas and example projects not even 24 hours later. How awesome is that?! I think there’s more than enough passion here in the community to eventually build the apps ArenaNet first set out to offer us. Interested?
