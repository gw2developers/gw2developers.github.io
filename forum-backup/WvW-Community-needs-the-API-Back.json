The health of the community depends on these services.  I understand that it is broken or parts of it are broken.  However it is imperative that sites such as mos.millenium.org/na/matchups/ and <a href=\"https://wvwintel.com/\">https://wvwintel.com/</a> are working even if nothing else works.  Please hurry with up with it we need it.</p>","arenanet":false}]}
