Keep up the great work.</p>\n<p>Now if you add real-time WvW maps…you’ll be the one-stop shop for real-time API info.<img src=\"/include/images/smilies/colondee.png\"> I’ve already got you bookmarked and will be stopping by often.</p>\n<p>I used the temples page and maps yesterday to finish my world completion on a second character.

The DNS is still propagating so use <a href=\"5.135.157.160\">5.135.157.160</a> if it doesn’t work for you.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.gw2state.com/events.html\"><ins>Real-Time Event Maps</ins></a><br>\n- All active events and meta-events on the map, very easy/fast to switch map and server.<br>\n- When you hover over an event, you see where its location on the map (killer feature!)<br>\n- Resizable high-resolution map if you need to find a missing heart/poi/etc. in the zone.<br>\n- Player Activity on the map in the last hour/day (very early, more stats coming soon!)<br>\n- Fully refreshed every 10 seconds with minimal bandwidth requirement.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.gw2state.com/boss.html\"><ins>Boss Notifier</ins></a><br>\n- All active bosses with (pre-)event start time (e.g. Defend CLEAN active for 3m45s)<br>\n- Optional audio alerts, keeps track of preferences (using localstorage, not cookies)<br>\n- Checkboxes to keep track of which bosses you still have to do today<br>\n- Works with multiple windows open to help with guesting</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.gw2state.com/temples.html\"><ins>Temple Status</ins></a><br>\n- Single page showing the status of all temples/dungeons on all servers.<br>\n- Shows temples with late pre-events so you can help out if it’s not open anywhere.<br>\n- Keeps track of <strong>all</strong> defense &amp; attack events for higher accuracy (e.g. Balthazar/Lyssa).</p>\n<p>I’ll be adding more features (e.g. event/world statistics) over the coming weeks and try to improve the design. If anyone has any feedback or has any idea on how to improve something, please let me know!
