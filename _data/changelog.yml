      * Each object in the "maps" array was given a "bonuses" array. This array gives information on which bonuses are coming from each map, and which team has them. "Borderlands Bloodlust" ownership information appears in this array.
      * Fixed a bug which prevented Ruins objectives which time-decayed to a neutral/uncaptured state from being listed as "Neutral".

  changes:
  - endpoint: [ "/v1/events" ]
    text: Added a new state called `"Inactive"`
      The inactive state is slightly different from the warmup state. An event in warmup is waiting for specific criteria to startup (usually, some amount of time must pass). An inactive event will stay inactive until it is activated by some external event.
