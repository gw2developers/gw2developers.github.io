It is such a great feature for the game and an enormous possibility for programmer (like me) to do some cool stuff related to the game.</p>\n<p>I just wanted to look into items/recipes: any chance that we could get items in collections? E.g. pass in a collection of ids and get a collection of item/recipe details? Or getting items by the type?</p>\n<p>That would be awesome!</p>\n<p>Thanks again for the amazing job you’re doing.</p>\n<p>Cheers,<br>\nNils</p>","arenanet":false}]}
