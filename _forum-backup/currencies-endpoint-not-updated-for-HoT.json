With the launch of HoT the endpoint <a href=\"https://api.guildwars2.com/v2/account/wallet\">https://api.guildwars2.com/v2/account/wallet</a> returns the new currencies correctly as they are gathered by the account.<br>\nThe second endpoint to make use of this data, <a href=\"https://api.guildwars2.com/v2/currencies\">https://api.guildwars2.com/v2/currencies</a> doesn’t contain the new ids so we can’t cross-reference it.</p>\n<p>Is this a bug or is there a new endpoint I am not aware of?</p>","arenanet":false}]}
