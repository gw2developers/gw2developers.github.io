Instead of doing something manual, you could designate a commander for event, and then periodically poll where other guild members are, and if they are near-ish the commander during those times, give auto-credit. (Assumes guild members submit a suitable API key, of course).</li>\n\t<li>WvW, having a map where you can see what part of the quadri-verse the other (registered) commanders on your server are rampaging. Bonus Points: include dorito color, and supplyinfo/squadinfo counts.</li>\n\t<li>I have 16+ characters on my account… where did I park them all?</li>\n\t<li>What map instance am I on, and what events are in my general area? (Makes events endpoint useful again in a megaserver world) I’m not gonna move THAT far in 10s w/o portaling.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Could most of this be done by having everyone download some app that reads the mumble data, and then streams the data to some central server? Sure. But people can do that now, and for the most part they don’t, because it’s too cumbersome.</p>\n<p>That said, I wouldn’t this high on the priority list.</p>","arenanet":false},{"pubDate":"2015-09-23T17:07:25.000Z","guid":"http://forum-en.guildwars2.com/forum/community/api/API-for-retriving-player-coordinates/5520082","author":"TorquedSoul.8097","body":"\n<p>Just knowing whether a character is active and what map they on would be huge for those organizing large groups (WvW and Raids).

This is a request for a feature that I know very few will use, but let me explain my backstory.</p>\n<p>I have been a frequent Wiki contributer who pretty much contributes solely on the Cartography project. I mainly do the mapping. If you you look at a wiki page for a zone and see the map image with white boundaries around each explorable area, it was probably me that did it. It is a very tedious process to define the boundaries of explorable areas, and takes many hours just to complete one zone. If current player coordinates (and BONUS: current explorable area<img src=\"/include/images/smilies/smile.png\">) were implemented it would not only make the mapping of the new HoT maps much quicker, but I would also be able to map much more detailed and accurate boundaries for existing ones.</p>\n<p>I don’t feel entitled to this being implemented, but words would not be able to describe my gratitude if it was implemented.</p>\n<p>Thank you.</p>","arenanet":false}]}
