This means it only works on desktop machines at this time (no mobile).</p>\n<p><strong>How to use:</strong></p>\n<p>Should be mostly straight forwards, but note:</p>\n<ul>\n\t<li>The triangle button shows/hides filtering options</li>\n\t<li>Double clicking or ctrl-clicking a skin in the selection pane will toggle its locked status.</li>\n\t<li>The ability to import/export the locked state of all skins is available from the about page (question-mark button).</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>How does it use the API:</strong></p>\n<p>Skins, skin icons, the items providing skins and the recipes producing items are all sourced from the API. These are combined with supplemental data adding additional items (where missing from the API), acquisition methods, collections and sets.</p>","arenanet":false}]}
