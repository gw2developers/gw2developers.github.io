I was unable to work on it for the last month <a href=\"https://twitter.com/vitalekj/status/344504453073879040\">due to a major life event</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>Separate resource daemons</strong>:</p>\n<p>The original GW2 client interface, [GW2Client sharedClient], has been removed. Instead, <em>Events</em>, <em>Items</em>, <em>WvW</em>, <em>Guilds</em>, &amp; <em>Maps</em> are now their own separate API client interfaces, referred to as <strong>daemons</strong>. This might not seem that important, but I’m really proud of this design decision and what it means for the framework’s future.</p>\n<p>The daemons in this release are the minimum viable product with respect to their corresponding API endpoints (lots of opportunity to make them individually more sophisticated). Developers can utilize just the daemons their app needs, and expect new daemons as the GW2’s API feature set expands*.</p>\n<p><strong>Map Endpoints:</strong></p>\n<p>I added the map endpoints (finally):</p>\n<ul>\n\t<li>v1/continents.json,</li>\n\t<li>v1/maps.json,</li>\n\t<li>v1/map_floor.json</li>\n</ul>\n<p><em>Note, I’ve purposefully let out map rendering for the time being, but this won’t always be the case. I plan to add map rendering as part of the framework around the time iOS 7 is released*.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Better cross-platform support</strong></p>\n<p>I’m getting much better at writing SDKs that target iOS &amp; OS X simultaneously. To try out some example code, open <em>GW2KitTests.xcodeproj</em> and pick your platform of choice.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>(*) <em>“Is this being used?”</em> – A survey:</p>\n<p>I’m completely in the dark as to whether GW2Kit has been used by anyone besides myself. I’ve seen a couple of iOS projects posted here, and I’m curious if any of them are using GW2Kit.</p>\n<p>It would be really awesome to hear from devs that are making awesome things with GW2Kit (if any)! Feedback is very much welcomed. If there are bugs – etc., I encourage you to open issues on project’s GitHub page.</p>","arenanet":false},{"pubDate":"2013-06-03T17:05:52.000Z","guid":"http://forum-en.guildwars2.com/forum/community/api/GW2Kit-An-Obj-C-framework-for-iOS-OS-X/2147349","author":"Killer Rhino.6794","body":"\n<p><strong>GW2Kit is Feature Complete</strong><br>\n<a href=\"https://github.com/KevinVitale/GW2Kit\">GW2Kit on GitHub</a></p>\n<p>The SDK has been updated with the past week’s API changes.</p>\n<p><em>Updated with</em>:</p>\n<ul>\n\t<li>guild_details.json</li>\n\t<li>colors.json</li>\n\t<li>build.json</li>\n\t<li>recipe_details.json (Updated)</li>\n\t<li>wvw/matches.json (Updated)</li>\n</ul>\n<p><em>Already Had</em>:</p>\n<ul>\n\t<li>items.json</li>\n\t<li>item_details.json</li>\n\t<li>events.json</li>\n\t<li>event_names.json</li>\n\t<li>map_names.json</li>\n\t<li>world_names.json</li>\n\t<li>wvw/matches.json</li>\n\t<li>wvw/match_details.json</li>\n\t<li>wvw/objective_names.json</li>\n\t<li>recipes.json</li>\n\t<li>recipe_details.json</li>\n</ul>\n<p><em>Quick Note: The iOS Demo runs the same color demo I’ve been exhibiting in other threads.

I’ve tried to take a much more domain orientated approach, hiding the fact that data is even remotely hosted.</p>\n<p>For example, fetching Worlds and WvW data is a call to;</p>\n<p>[[GW2API sharedAPI] fetchCollection:GW2APIDomainCollectionWorldVsWorld<br>\n                        completionBlock:^(GW2APIDomainCollection collection) {<br>\n                            <br>\n                        }];</p>\n<p>The idea is that you ask the API for meaningful collections of data, as opposed to dealing with services directly which is, ultimately what you’ve written. If you only want one specific set of stuff, perhaps you want to quickly get new WvW scores, so you can simply ask the API to update that area of the domain by simply passing the class we’re dealing with;</p>\n<p>[[GW2API sharedAPI] fetch:[GW2Matchup class]<br>\n                        completionBlock:^(id domain) {<br>\n                            <br>\n                        }];</p>\n<p>Again, good work chap. I hope to round my stuff out in the next day or two and kick it up to Github.</p>","arenanet":false},{"pubDate":"2013-05-22T06:31:28.000Z","guid":"http://forum-en.guildwars2.com/forum/community/api/GW2Kit-An-Obj-C-framework-for-iOS-OS-X/2071721","author":"McVillano.9256","body":"\n<p>Hello mate, thank you for your effort, could be possible to do a little bit of documentation of the functions or examples in aplications.<br>\nI´m new at xcode.</p>","arenanet":false},{"pubDate":"2013-05-22T03:58:14.000Z","guid":"http://forum-en.guildwars2.com/forum/community/api/GW2Kit-An-Obj-C-framework-for-iOS-OS-X/2071287","author":"Murakami.5243","body":"\n<p>thanks for this resource mate<img src=\"/include/images/smilies/smile.png\"></p>","arenanet":false},{"pubDate":"2013-05-22T03:32:42.000Z","guid":"http://forum-en.guildwars2.com/forum/community/api/GW2Kit-An-Obj-C-framework-for-iOS-OS-X/2071210","author":"Killer Rhino.6794","body":"\n<p><strong>GW2Kit is Feature Complete</strong><br>\n<a href=\"https://github.com/KevinVitale/GW2Kit\">GW2Kit on GitHub</a></p>\n<p>The SDK allows any valid parameters to be in each request.</p>\n<p><em>Currently Has</em>:</p>\n<ul>\n\t<li>items.json</li>\n\t<li>item_details.json</li>\n\t<li>events.json</li>\n\t<li>event_names.json</li>\n\t<li>map_names.json</li>\n\t<li>world_names.json</li>\n\t<li>wvw/matches.json</li>\n\t<li>wvw/match_details.json</li>\n\t<li>wvw/objective_names.json</li>\n\t<li>recipes.json</li>\n\t<li>recipe_details.json</li>\n</ul>\n<p><em>Next steps</em>:</p>\n<ul>\n\t<li>Turn on asynchronous network requests (highest priority)</li>\n\t<li>Improved unit tests</li>\n\t<li>How-to Wiki on GitHub</li>\n\t<li>Better code documentation</li>\n</ul>","arenanet":false},{"pubDate":"2013-05-21T20:15:13.000Z","guid":"http://forum-en.guildwars2.com/forum/community/api/GW2Kit-An-Obj-C-framework-for-iOS-OS-X/2069444","author":"link.4615","body":"\n<p>One minor API suggestion; a lot of libraries use ‘completionBlock:’ rather than ‘completion:’.
