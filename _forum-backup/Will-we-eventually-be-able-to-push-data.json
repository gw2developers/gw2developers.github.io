For developers, this will involve signing up for an API key, getting a quota of API calls, etc. For users, there will be a new login flow where they authorize apps to take certain actions on their behalf.</p>\n<p>OAuth2 support will enable many more personalized APIs to be created. Guild, Chat, Character, and other APIs are all possible. We don’t currently have a planned release date for OAuth2, but we’re actively working on implementing it.</p></div></blockquote>","arenanet":false},{"pubDate":"2013-06-21T18:29:51.000Z","guid":"http://forum-en.guildwars2.com/forum/community/api/Will-we-eventually-be-able-to-push-data/2257104","author":"Blumoon.5437","body":"\n<p>One of the most exciting selling points of the Extended Experience as it was originally presented was the ability to not only pull data from the game, but push data back in, as well. This allowed for exciting functionality like out-of-game guild chat, pinging the in-game map for your friends, and more. Will we eventually see this functionality through the API ecosystem?</p>","arenanet":false}]}
