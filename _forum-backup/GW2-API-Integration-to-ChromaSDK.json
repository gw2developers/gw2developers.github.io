Due to technical constraints, the data received by the web API can be up to 5 minutes stale (e.g., it’s reading player data from the database rather than the map server which only writes back periodically, not in realtime). Eventually I’d like to have a system whereby you could get this data directly from the client (and we have <a href=\"https://github.com/arenanet/api-cdi/blob/master/mumble.md\">some data available locally</a>), but that’s a long ways out.
