So, without further ado, some new endpoints:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://api.guildwars2.com/v2/pvp/seasons?ids=all\"><strong>/v2/pvp/seasons</strong></a> (<a href=\"https://github.com/arenanet/api-cdi/blob/master/v2/pvp/seasons.js\">github</a>)</p>\n<p>Provides bulk-expanded unauthenticated access to PvP season data. The season ids are referenced from both /v2/pvp/games (ranked games playing during a season will have a season_id field) and /v2/pvp/standings. It doesn’t currently indicate which season is the current season (or the start/end dates) — that functionality will land in a future release.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://api.guildwars2.com/v2/pvp/standings?access_token=51969C37-FA95-744C-BB29-075C684EBD33C086D050-124E-4575-994B-304F23DA6F70\"><strong>/v2/pvp/standings</strong></a> (<a href=\"https://github.com/arenanet/api-cdi/blob/master/v2/pvp/standings.js\">github</a>)</p>\n<p>Provides authenticated access to your PvP season standings (including past seasons). This currently only includes the division standings (not leaderboard position) — hoping to get the leaderboard bits in at a later date.</p>\n<p><strong>/v2/guild/:id/teams</strong> (<a href=\"https://github.com/arenanet/api-cdi/blob/master/v2/guild/teams.js\">github</a>)</p>\n<p>Provides authenticated access to your guilds’ teams. Currently only available to guild leaders (though I’m debating relaxing that restriction for this endpoint). It provides aggregate match data (similar to /v2/pvp/stats). Hoping to add per-team game history at some point in the future, but that will likely be a separate endpoint.</p>\n<p>Let me know if you have any questions/concerns or find any bugs!</p>","arenanet":true}]}
