Because ascended trinkets and back items don’t have a standard upgrade slot, they instead have a “baked-in” ascended jewel.  These baked-in stats are supplied as a buff, rather than being part of the base attributes.  As I said above, I believe this to be due to how the base attributes are generated during item creation.</p>\n<p>When ascended trinkets were first introduced, the base attributes and the buff’s attributes were listed separately in the tooltip.  Refer to this screenshot from November 2012:</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://wiki.guildwars2.com/images/archive/2/22/20131223230756%21Ascended_example.png\">http://wiki.guildwars2.com/images/archive/2/22/20131223230756%21Ascended_example.png</a></p>\n<p>This actually reminded me that Magic Find was treated the same as Boon/Condition Duration, it always had to be added as a buff.  That’s why Yakkington’s Ring shows two entries for Power/Precision but only one for MF – Power/Precision are the only base attributes, the base MF and the jewel’s MF are added together in the buff.</p>\n<p>In May 2013, this was changed so that the base and buff attributes are added together in the tooltip: <a href=\"http://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Game_updates/2013-05-28#Guild_Wars_2_Wiki_Notes_2\">http://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Game_updates/2013-05-28#Guild_Wars_2_Wiki_Notes_2</a></p>\n<hr>\n<p>I can’t explain All Seeing or Engagement Ring.
