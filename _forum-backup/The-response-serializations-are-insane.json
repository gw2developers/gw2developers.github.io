As you can see, the fact that they nest their response dictionary inside of the Continents variable is a non-issue. If they ever got rid of that, I could just change my ContinentsResponse class to not have any variables and simply extend the Dictionary&lt;string, Continent&gt; class and update any references I’m using.</p>\n<p>You can argue about refactoring code until you’re blue in the face and there will always be other people who argue that it needs to be refactored again. Your complaint was specifically around the difficulty of deserializing the response due to the desired content being nested inside of a dictionary variable in the response object, instead of the response object simply being the dictionary variable (or a list).</p>\n<p>It sounds more like your deserializer doesn’t handle nested objects very well, otherwise it would be a non-issue. This is very much a solved problem at this point and there should be existing libraries that can handle this quite elegantly for you in Java.</p>","arenanet":false},{"pubDate":"2014-01-18T15:55:37.000Z","guid":"http://forum-en.guildwars2.com/forum/community/api/The-response-serializations-are-insane/3514319","author":"Morhyn.8032","body":"\n<blockquote><div class=\"citey\"><cite title=\"Posted on January 18 2014 12:39PM\"><a href=\"/forum/community/api/The-response-serializations-are-insane/3513736\">StevenL.3761:</a></cite></div><div class=\"quotey\"><blockquote><div class=\"citey\"><cite title=\"Posted on January 18 2014 12:53AM\"><a href=\"/forum/community/api/The-response-serializations-are-insane/3511609\">Kegsay.7068:</a></cite></div><div class=\"quotey\"><p>At this point, it would be far more damaging to change the spec and break everyone’s stuff, so I would prefer it if no changes were made.

The result includes the method name, “continents”, as a key in the result.</p>\n<p>JSON is merely a simple representation of the data. It does not have a target language (despite being valid JavaScript). From <a href=\"http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4627.txt\">http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4627.txt</a> (emphasis added) —</p>\n<blockquote><div class=\"quotey\"><p>JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) is a lightweight, text-based,<br>\n   <strong>language-independent</strong> data interchange format.  It was derived from<br>\n   the ECMAScript Programming Language Standard.  JSON defines a small<br>\n   set of formatting rules for the portable representation of structured<br>\n   data.</p></div></blockquote>\n<p>But let’s look at a concrete example using JavaScript — <a href=\"http://jsfiddle.net/jsumners/vH5W8/\">http://jsfiddle.net/jsumners/vH5W8/</a>. Notice that even in JavaScript the true result of the API method call has to be dereferenced from the included key. Thus, you can’t simply loop over what is returned from the API call.</p>\n<p>Yes, in JavaScript this isn’t so much of a problem. You can mostly just shrug it off and move on. But when you start importing this data into a language with proper types (e.g. Java in my case or C# in a previous poster’s), it adds unnecessary complications. The API could be simpler and better if it just didn’t include the method name as a key.</p>","arenanet":false},{"pubDate":"2014-01-16T14:39:45.000Z","guid":"http://forum-en.guildwars2.com/forum/community/api/The-response-serializations-are-insane/3504057","author":"smiley.1438","body":"\n<p>Just btw. – We’re talking about <a href=\"http://json.org/\">JSON</a> here.
