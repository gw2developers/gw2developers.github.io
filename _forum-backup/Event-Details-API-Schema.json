One thing   I noticed is that it seems that Event IDs are being used as a field in the Event Details returned objects.  For example let’s say I make this call: <a href=\"https://api.guildwars2.com/v1/event_details.json?event_id=16554045-EFE8-4248-8B78-E4BB46CA94F5\"></a><a href=\"https://api.guildwars2.com/v1/event_details.json?event_id=16554045-EFE8-4248-8B78-E4BB46CA94F5\">https://api.guildwars2.com/v1/event_details.json?event_id=16554045-EFE8-4248-8B78-E4BB46CA94F5</a>.  In return I get this back:<br>\n</p><pre><code>{\n  \"events\": {\n    \"16554045-EFE8-4248-8B78-E4BB46CA94F5\": {\n      \"name\": \"Stop the skritt burglar before it escapes with the treasure.\",\n      \"level\": 29,\n      \"map_id\": 24,\n      \"flags\": [],\n      \"location\": {\n        \"type\": \"sphere\",\n        \"center\": [\n          -12077.3,\n          -1391.04,\n          -204.884\n        ],\n        \"radius\": 3500,\n        \"rotation\": 0\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}</code></pre><p></p>\n<p>The way it’s written it looks like Event ID is actually a field and not an attribute.  This doesn’t smell right to me since that implies that my Events object would have <em>n</em> fields where <em>n</em> is the number of events.  I’v never seen JSON structured this way.  Any thoughts on how to parse this in an object-oriented manner?</p>","arenanet":false}]}
