This could be related to how the characters seem to always be returned in a random order.  So currently it seems impossible to request all of the characters on an account with more than 50.</p>\n<p>Would it be possible to simply up the page total to the account character limit (68? instead of 50) to get around this or something?</p>","arenanet":false}]}
