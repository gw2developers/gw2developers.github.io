You can still just open 3 browser windows for your 3 servers.</p>\n<p>What they did was add a line of code into the page that prevents the timers from loading if the page is embedded within another page. Their reason was that someone was embedding their page and spam refreshing it, causing it to reload all the resources (scripts and images) over and over, which is a waste of bandwidth. The change however does not stop those resources from loading, just the timers, so if they’re still spamming, their still reloading all the scripts. The person probably stopped however, since there’s no point in loading empty timers.</p>","arenanet":false},{"pubDate":"2013-06-10T00:25:33.000Z","guid":"http://forum-en.guildwars2.com/forum/community/api/Metaevent-API-request/2184344","author":"Geotherma.2395","body":"\n<blockquote><div class=\"citey\"><cite title=\"Posted on June 09 2013 10:48PM\"><a href=\"/forum/community/api/Metaevent-API-request/2183981\">Healix.5819:</a></cite></div><div class=\"quotey\"><p>Basically, it’s the same thing as opening 3 windows and positioning them on top of each other so you can see all 3 at once.

Just going off the reddit, I program a little but I don’t understand API much… The multi server thing was great because for casuals with maybe only 1-3 hours a day they could catch their favorite events, especially with alts. Also embedding on guild sites doesn’t seem to work right.</p>","arenanet":false},{"pubDate":"2013-06-09T22:48:40.000Z","guid":"http://forum-en.guildwars2.com/forum/community/api/Metaevent-API-request/2183981","author":"Healix.5819","body":"\n<p>Basically, it’s the same thing as opening 3 windows and positioning them on top of each other so you can see all 3 at once.

Most hardcore players know where these events are and would just prefer an easy to use website.</p>\n<p>My suggestion would be to have three drop down menus, and from these menus, you can choose a server. Below these menus you will see the active metaevents. Even better if you’d be able to design an overlay with this information packed neatly in a corner!</p>","arenanet":false}]}
