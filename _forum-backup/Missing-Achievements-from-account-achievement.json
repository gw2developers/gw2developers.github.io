If it is for example at 1/5 it will work. But if it is at 0/5 it will not work. For some reason the API is not providing the completion status if you stop exactly at a checkpoint of a repeatable achievement. For many I stopped exactly when a checkpoint was reached so it does not show up under “almost completed” ingame.
