I can’t test it by myself, but maybe that achievement generate an exception in API, because from your picture you have 72copper in your wallet right now, but that doesn’t mean that you havent reached a bigger value and I think that everyone has earned at least 1gold that counts as 10ap for the achievement.<br>\nThe current value of achievement id=10 should be the gold value in your wallet if it hasn’t already been completed, because the achievement itself requires that you have a total of 200g in your wallet.<br>\nI make an example: if I earn 3g and I spend 2.5g after, my wallet is equal to 50s; that means I have got the first step of the achievement id=10, but for the second one I’m back to only 50s. So when you calculate the ap from achievement id=10 you think that you are still at step 0 while you aren’t.<br>\nActually the reason above is the only one that make sense to me right know and it’s exactly 10ap that you are missing.</p>\n<p>p.s.: Lawton could confirm if I’m wrong about it too<img src=\"/include/images/smilies/colondee.png\"></p>","arenanet":false},{"pubDate":"2017-01-20T10:58:04.000Z","guid":"http://forum-en.guildwars2.com/forum/community/api/API-achievement-points-differ-to-ingame-value/6469967","author":"Zok.4956","body":"\n<blockquote><div class=\"citey\"><cite title=\"Posted on January 19 2017 06:22PM\"><a href=\"/forum/community/api/API-achievement-points-differ-to-ingame-value/6469386\">Lawton Campbell.8517:</a></cite></div><div class=\"quotey\"><p>Are you adding the daily_ap and monthly_ap from <a href=\"https://api.guildwars2.com/v2/account?access_token=7CEA47F8-3970-044C-9FCE-402C1949987748D89AE3-1A8C-4323-BB0A-98979DE5B7DC\">/v2/account</a> as well?
