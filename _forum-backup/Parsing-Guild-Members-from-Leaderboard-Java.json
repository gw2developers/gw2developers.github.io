I’ve tried debugging but I can’t quite see what’s wrong…</p>\n<p>Can anyone tell me what’s wrong here?</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://pastebin.com/tW5Zp3fb\">http://pastebin.com/tW5Zp3fb</a></p>\n<p>This obviously isn’t my code EXACTLY, just what you’d need to figure out what’s wrong… My parsing of the page is still working correctly.. it just seems that it doesn’t actually go to the guild page and instead parses the top of the AP leaderboards.. leading me to believe either I have not successfully logged in OR not successfully navigated to the guild page.</p>","arenanet":false}]}
