The brutebyte.com has very inaccurate info. For example, it claims that my guild is based on “Borlis Pass”. While it was originally created there, it hasn’t claimed anything in BP for a long time. So yeah, one person who can claim could have transferred and claimed an objective. There are no restrictions. Unless guild itself polices and kicks people from particular servers, you can be anywhere (and multiple objectives can be claimed — one on each map)</p>","arenanet":false},{"pubDate":"2015-07-27T19:06:39.000Z","guid":"http://forum-en.guildwars2.com/forum/community/api/WvW-Server-info/5323846","author":"Edgar Doiron.2804","body":"\n<p>That’s what I thought, but validated with  <a href=\"http://gw2.brutebyte.com/\">http://gw2.brutebyte.com/</a></p>\n<p>and I had this guild in my list, <br>\n[Kast] Les Kastors<br>\n<a href=\"http://gw2.brutebyte.com/guild?guild_key=EE41FD55-0D3B-4788-AE37-4F14D4A6A9B5\">http://gw2.brutebyte.com/guild?guild_key=EE41FD55-0D3B-4788-AE37-4F14D4A6A9B5</a></p>\n<p>And they’ve only been associated with FC</p>","arenanet":false},{"pubDate":"2015-07-27T17:27:20.000Z","guid":"http://forum-en.guildwars2.com/forum/community/api/WvW-Server-info/5323555","author":"Lawton Campbell.8517","body":"\n<p>I would guess that there’s some FC guild members on SF.
