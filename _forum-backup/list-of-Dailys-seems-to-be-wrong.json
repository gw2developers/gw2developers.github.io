The thing is: Daily Kryta Vista Viewer isn’t even one of the dailys today. And it also doesn’t count if you do it. There are some more PvE dailys listed, which don’t count. And every day the list changes and lists too many points.</p>\n<p>The jumping puzzle which would be a daily today isn’t listed at all and from what I could see, the jumping puzzle isn’t listed at all inside all the 2455 achievements currently available. I only was able to found 13 of the 46 jumping puzzles available.</p>","arenanet":false}]}
