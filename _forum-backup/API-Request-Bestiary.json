Something that listed the enemies/NPCs associated with a map and/or event and then gives their stats and skill_ids (to attach to an almost inevitable skill output).  Of course, this would be most interesting if we could get it for instanced areas like dungeons and storyline as well.

The types and stats would still be nice though.</p>","arenanet":false},{"pubDate":"2013-05-29T01:07:11.000Z","guid":"http://forum-en.guildwars2.com/forum/community/api/API-Request-Bestiary/2110312","author":"Killer Rhino.6794","body":"\n<p>Not an immediate concern, but having a bestiary API would be interesting, no?</p>","arenanet":false}]}
