Even the xBox One interface itself is getting it built in and you can already do something similar with the 360 and the <a href=\"http://www.xbox.com/en-AU/smartglass\">xBox smartglass</a> system.</p>\n<p>I know its a long shot this ever being included into the game or the api’s are made to allow the community to do this even though the developers did show there <a href=\"http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2010/09/21/guild-wars-2-extended-experience-missus/\">extended experience</a> at one stage.</p>\n<p>I’ve been waiting for the extended interface for many pc games for ages to be able to interact view live progress etc all from my nice tablet and with the xBox One games doing it its a nice start but pc needs some lovin to as its going to become a common thing eventually.</p>","arenanet":false}]}
