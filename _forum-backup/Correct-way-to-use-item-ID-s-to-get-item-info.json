Then I loop through them, creating a request URL that consists of around 190 IDs (because for some reason 200 didn’t always work for me), then storing that URL in an array, and moving on to the next URL with the next 190 items. Then you simply loop through those URLs instead, bringing 40k+ requests down to around 200.</p>","arenanet":false},{"pubDate":"2015-05-19T23:08:01.000Z","guid":"http://forum-en.guildwars2.com/forum/community/api/Correct-way-to-use-item-ID-s-to-get-item-info/5081580","author":"paddle.9654","body":"\n<blockquote><div class=\"citey\"><cite title=\"Posted on May 19 2015 12:44PM\"><a href=\"/forum/community/api/Correct-way-to-use-item-ID-s-to-get-item-info/5079506\">Teranas.6150:</a></cite></div><div class=\"quotey\"><p>You may want to create a database for the item data and only request them once a week or day.</p>\n<p>For requesting massive data you should use pagination.

My method is as follows:</p>\n<ol>\n\t<li>getJSON on the ‘v2/commerce/prices’ to get a listing of all the ID’s which are in the shop.</li>\n\t<li>Create a loop for all the ID’s in step one</li>\n\t<li>Inside the loop getJSON for ‘/v2/items?id=Step_1_ID’ which allows me to access the ‘name’, ‘icon’ and other info.</li>\n\t<li>Inside the loop getJSON for ‘v2/commerce/prices?id=Step_1_ID’ which allows me to get the ‘buy’ and ‘sell’ info.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>I feel like i am approaching this wrong and am creating way too many requests which could be simplified greatly.</p>\n<p>I have also tried this method with PHP however it was extremely slow. I tried optimising it with curl however when running around 100-200 items it would take about 3 seconds per item.</p>\n<p>The goal of doing this would be to create my own local json file which could then be updated and used to populate a mysql database.</p>","arenanet":false}]}
