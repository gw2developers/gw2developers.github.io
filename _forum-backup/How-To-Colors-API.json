Plucking out a single color dictionary in the color response looks like this:</p>\n<pre><code>\n691: {\n    name: \"Spring Dew\"\n    cloth: {\n        brightness: 27\n        contrast: 1.25\n        hue: 190\n        saturation: 0.3125\n        lightness: 0.644531\n    }\n    leather: {\n        brightness: 27\n        contrast: 1.28906\n        hue: 190\n        saturation: 0.253906\n        lightness: 0.664063\n    }\n    metal: {\n        brightness: 27\n        contrast: 1.28906\n        hue: 190\n        saturation: 0.234375\n        lightness: 0.664063\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p></p>\n<p><strong>Materials</strong></p>\n<p>Default, cloth, leather, and metal are <em>materials</em>. The dye picker in the game uses the <strong>cloth</strong> material, so if you plan on doing something similar, use the <strong>cloth</strong> material (we’ll get to how to produce colors from these values in a second).</p>\n<p><strong>Color Components</strong></p>\n<p>Each material contains the following: brightness, contrast, hue, saturation, &amp; lightness</p>\n<p><em>brightness:</em></p>\n<ul>\n\t<li>A negative or positive number (range unknown)</li>\n</ul>\n<p><em>contrast:</em></p>\n<ul>\n\t<li>A value between 0 – 2</li>\n</ul>\n<p><em>hue:</em></p>\n<ul>\n\t<li>A value between 0 – 360</li>\n</ul>\n<p><em>saturation:</em></p>\n<ul>\n\t<li>A value between 0 – 2</li>\n\t<li>A value of 1.0 will mean “no change”</li>\n</ul>\n<p><em>lightness:</em></p>\n<ul>\n\t<li>A value between 0 – 2</li>\n\t<li>A value of 1.0 will mean “no change”</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The purpose of these components is to <strong>shift a reference (base) color</strong>. What does that mean? Starting with the base color, we’re going to use these values to perform calculations that will get us the actual color we want.</p>\n<p><strong>Base Color</strong></p>\n<p>The base color will start in the RGB colorspace. In whatever language, framework, or library you work in, get a color object in the RGB colorspace that has the values:</p>\n<p>R:128, G:26, B:26.</p>\n<p><strong>The Color Algorithm</strong></p>\n<blockquote><div class=\"citey\"><cite title=\"Posted on June 03 2013 08:55PM\"><a href=\"/forum/community/api/How-To-Colors-API/2148826\">Cliff Spradlin.3512:</a></cite></div><div class=\"quotey\"><p>I just updated the API to show the base_rgb of colors.
