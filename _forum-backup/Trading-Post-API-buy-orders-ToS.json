Placing in-game buy orders is all I’m able to do so far, and it’s very time consuming and tedious.<br>\nI’m also aware that there is a fine line between this and a bot (in fact, the only change that would make the above a pure bot is to have it automatically do this every hour or so).  So I think I came up with an idea to not cross this line:<br>\nRegarding macros, Anet has said that it has to be 1 click = 1 action.  So what if 1 click = 1 buy order?  A script that gave you a list of things to buy, and a button on each one that said “place a buy order for this”.  Then you just go down the list clicking the ones you want to.  It would be less annoying than in-game TP as you wouldn’t have to search, type out the name, enter price, etc. but it’s still not automated and has human involvement.<br>\nIs this within the rules?  It would be good to know before doing all the work to make it.</p>","arenanet":false}]}
