I’m currently working on a solution to retrieve the items I need without making too many calls, and I was wondering about the build id in the API. The wiki doesn’t say a lot about it.</p>\n<p>Does that build id only changes when there is a new update to the game or it changes on other occasions too? Since my app will be keeping some info from the API so I don’t make to many requests to it, I was wondering if the build id could be used as a flag that the info saved from the API needs to be updated when the id number changes?</p>\n<p>Thank you<img src=\"/include/images/smilies/smile.png\"></p>","arenanet":false}]}
