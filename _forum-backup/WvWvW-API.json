Since it’s best-effort, some data might get dropped or delayed (not sure how frequently this happens). Because of this, there’s going to be some reporting latency. Due to our network architecture, it’s not something that can be worked around.</p>\n<p>EDIT: Well, it looks like there’s a bug or two with the PPK numbers. <a href=\"https://github.com/arenanet/api-cdi/issues/210\">tracking issue</a>.</p>","arenanet":true},{"pubDate":"2016-01-30T21:46:37.000Z","guid":"http://forum-en.guildwars2.com/forum/community/api/WvWvW-API/5959735","author":"AllIsVain.6409","body":"\n<p>PPK is here and the EU kills API changes numbers every 30 seconds, is this intended?</p>","arenanet":false},{"pubDate":"2016-01-26T19:10:56.000Z","guid":"http://forum-en.guildwars2.com/forum/community/api/WvWvW-API/5947134","author":"Arcan Soulstorm.4356","body":"\n<blockquote><div class=\"citey\"><cite title=\"Posted on December 21 2015 07:26PM\"><a href=\"/forum/community/api/WvWvW-API/5872196\">Lawton Campbell.8517:</a></cite></div><div class=\"quotey\"><blockquote><div class=\"citey\"><cite title=\"Posted on December 19 2015 01:51PM\"><a href=\"/forum/community/api/WvWvW-API/5867437\">Arcan Soulstorm.4356:</a></cite></div><div class=\"quotey\"><blockquote><div class=\"citey\"><cite title=\"Posted on November 02 2015 06:21PM\"><a href=\"/forum/community/api/WvWvW-API/5707972\">Lawton Campbell.8517:</a></cite></div><div class=\"quotey\"><blockquote><div class=\"citey\"><cite title=\"Posted on October 30 2015 07:34AM\"><a href=\"/forum/community/api/WvWvW-API/5689662\">Noodle.4510:</a></cite></div><div class=\"quotey\"><p>-Death/Kills aren’t present on EU match.</p></div></blockquote>\n<p>This is something I’m looking to get fixed in the future; I’m not really sure why those messages aren’t being propagated between DCs.
