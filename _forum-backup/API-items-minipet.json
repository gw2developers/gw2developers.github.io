Following the information on the wiki page <a href=\"http://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/API:2/items\">http://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/API:2/items</a> , I have tried to split all data by type. Currently there are 15 types of items, but the “MiniPet” type is incorrect. All the minipets in the API are “MiniPage” type.<br>\nIs this type (“MiniPage”) the right one or there is something wrong in API:2/items?</p>","arenanet":false}]}
