This is more than likely a result of the fact that the WEAPONS give different stats entirely than the armors and whatnot.</p>","arenanet":false},{"pubDate":"2016-06-29T21:28:26.000Z","guid":"http://forum-en.guildwars2.com/forum/community/api/stat-choices-in-items/6225850","author":"Lawton Campbell.8517","body":"\n<p>Yeah, that’s just how the content is — there’s probably a historical reason for it.

There is almost 4/5 of the stats in /v2/itemstats that have blank names, and some stats have multiple IDs (such as giver’s that has almost 10 different IDs).

Thanks for the bug report — will try to get those ids that you pointed out whitelisted today and will figure out a solution to get them whitelisted automatically in the future.

If we look at <a href=\"https://api.guildwars2.com/v2/items/79039\">Malicious Xera Backpiece</a>, we see one of the stats is ‘1114’, however if one tries to look up 1114 in /v2/itemstats, one gets <a href=\"https://api.guildwars2.com/v2/itemstats/1114\">nothing</a> .</p>\n<p>I’m not too sure where the issue comes from, but it seems a few of the stats are missing. For this item, only 6 of the 9 are ‘real’.</p>\n<p>Carrion (1038),  Celestial (588),  Rabid (585),  Sinister (1064),  Trailblazer’s (1115),  Viper’s(1130)<br>\n seem to link just fine, but I end up missing: Dire (754 or 756), Settler’s (693 or 700), Shaman’s (153).</p>\n<p>Thus, for some reason we are given IDs 1114, 690, and 1097 which go ‘nowhere’.</p>\n<p>Hopefully this helps in figuring out what’s happening; thanks for all the work!</p>\n<p>-Darqam</p>","arenanet":false}]}
