However the numbe of utility skills returned is wrong (4 instead of 3, with the 1st one always null). I.e., as of now on my guardian :</p>\n<pre><code>\"skills\": {\n        \"pve\": {\n            \"heal\": 312,\n            \"utilities\": [null, 310, 330, 255],\n            \"elite\": 4745\n        },\n        \"pvp\": {\n            \"heal\": 259,\n            \"utilities\": [null, 332, 327, 4746],\n            \"elite\": 4745\n        },\n        \"wvw\": {\n            \"heal\": 259,\n            \"utilities\": [null, 4858, 4862, 310],\n            \"elite\": 4745\n        }\n    }</code></pre>\n<p>Am I also right to asume that heal and elite return null when no skill equiped (i.e.: on low level toons).</p>","arenanet":false}]}
