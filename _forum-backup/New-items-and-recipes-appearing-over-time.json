For reference, the title is Obtained by placing in top 10 on Qualifying Points leaderboards [source: wiki, I don’t do sPvP]. But Legend is top 5, others are 25/50/100. It strains credulity that this one title in the middle wasn’t found until now. But let’s go ahead and say that the previous explanation still holds. Reality is wierd like that sometimes, and kittens your expectations.</p>\n<p>End Conclusion of this pass of data:<br>\n- Due to the “discoveries since time horizon” method of data inclusion, these lists are not a canonical list of items and recipes in the game.<br>\n- There are items which are known to exist, such as PvP runes, but are just rarely used.<br>\n- Known formulatic recipes are not included. For instance, one assumes you could create a Feast-like item of Garlic Bread (L15 -10% damage while stunned), but no one has bothered to pony up the Elonian Wine, Crystals, and Mystic Coins to find out. GW2DB knows the Tray of Garlic Bread to exist as item #63275. gw2spidy has 99 for sale as #12645.  No such item is in items.json, item_details.json, or recipe_details.json.</p>\n<p>Implications:<br>\n- “New” items will be discovered all the time.<br>\n- If making a tools such as a build analyzer, you may not be presenting all the available options.<br>\n- Any system you build will have to support items being discovered throughout the day. Static databases, with only infrequent updates, are not viable.</p>\n<p>Sadly, depending on your needs, gw2db may provide a superior API for you.</p>","arenanet":false}]}
