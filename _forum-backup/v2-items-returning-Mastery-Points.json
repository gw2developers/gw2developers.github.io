Since the API is (currently) just enumerating items, it doesn’t have the context to fill in those parameters (e.g., it would need the mastery point reference which points to that particular item; there’s no back-reference) so it just trims it out, which leaves the leading space.</p>\n<p>It’s something that should probably be fixed in the long run, but there’s still quite a bit of lower-hanging fruit left  :/</p>\n<blockquote><div class=\"citey\"><cite title=\"Posted on December 11 2015 02:18PM\"><a href=\"/forum/community/api/v2-items-returning-Mastery-Points/5846108\">Invisiplous.6094:</a></cite></div><div class=\"quotey\"><p>Also it looks like ids 6 and 46748 have been whitelisted prematurely since their names are currently like “((1234))”.
