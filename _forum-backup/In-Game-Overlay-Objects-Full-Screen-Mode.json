After playing with those items i found there is a significant performance degradation of  FPS. Investigated a little and found that .Net and other Lenguages that create Frame over Windows have exactly the same problem.</p>\n<p>So investigated a little more on Mumble code , Fraps,  and other APP’s that have support for Overlay Objects on in-game full-screen mode. Found a guy called Matt’s  that created an API to do what Mumble do . As He specifies in his website the Direct3D 9 API Interceptor can do what i was looking for , intercept GW2 objects and giving me the option to implement my own Overlay object without ( i hope ) any performance degradation and Full-Screen Mode support.</p>\n<p>Well , so my question is , any1 have any development running on for that kind of implementations?</p>","arenanet":false}]}
