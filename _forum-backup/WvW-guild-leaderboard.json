Theres actually a lot of funny things you can do with the currrent API – even track guild home world movings and stuff. The idea of my database was to keep detailed records for the current (and maybe most recent) matchups – not just points/income at a given time in the match but also objectives and guilds who owned the objective at this time – combined with the maps API etc. However, it’s currently suspended due to a lack of interest in GW2 and i can’t run it on my webspace because i’d need a huge database (~100MB data per week or so) which is impossible for me. So if someone has the resources and some ideas, feel free to fork!<img src=\"/include/images/smilies/smile.png\"></p>","arenanet":false},{"pubDate":"2014-04-24T22:00:16.000Z","guid":"http://forum-en.guildwars2.com/forum/community/api/WvW-guild-leaderboard/3953304","author":"Marxist Breakfast.9613","body":"\n<p>There plenty of apps out there that track WvW server score… but I couldn’t find any that tracked WvW guild activity.
