I can speculate that GET headers requests are stored in ram until they are completly received (POST should be directly writed to disk I think). When a GET request exceed a certain amount of data, the server stop to accept the request and reply with an error. The client may continue to send the request, but the server drop any further data coming from that request. Disabling such a feature will force the server to wait (and load in ram) the entire request before thinking of a reply. What will happen if you send 2000 simultaneously request each with 200000000 characters with this security feature disabled? The server start to load each request in ram, and wait until each request is completly received, server will start to have ram problem very soon, will start to use swap, will slow down, and will crash if such type of request continue to come. The results are that it’s not necessary a lot of bandwidth to crash a server, it’s only needed that you send multiple request at the same time. So disabling this feature will let GW2 API server be very vulnerable to DOS attacks, that in this case may cause a server crash, not only a service interruption.</p>\n<p>It’s never a good idea to disable a security feature, expecially if it is enabled by default.</p>\n<blockquote><div class=\"citey\"><cite title=\"Posted on October 03 2014 06:57PM\"><a href=\"/forum/community/api/API-errors-bugs/4464072\">StevenL.3761:</a></cite></div><div class=\"quotey\"><blockquote><div class=\"citey\"><cite title=\"Posted on October 03 2014 05:33PM\"><a href=\"/forum/community/api/API-errors-bugs/4463878\">Alcarin.9024:</a></cite></div><div class=\"quotey\"><p>If you get a 4xx error, you have to understand why your request is wrong, not why you dont receive an extensive response from the server that explain why your request is wrong.</p></div></blockquote>\n<p>The request isn’t necessarily wrong.

I don’t know IIS, but this response is seems to me like error page configured in apache, in this case when apache read the request, it reject it and reply with its default error page (in this case reply with a 404 error, but it should reply with 414 error) that it’s a plain html file similar to all error page saw in GW2 web services.

It turns out as you suspected there is some concatenation at play here, as dictated by some special markup and is different for each language translation.
