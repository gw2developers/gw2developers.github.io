Like a personal use skada or recount type app?</p>\n<p>I’m talking personal use, not group monitoring stuff.</p>\n<p>I believe having more access to numbers would be great considering roles and gear are becoming more important for end game stuff like raids and fractals. It would also help players provide accurate and factual feedback to developers about skills and powers. Bug detection could be made easier for players too… Having more transparency would definitely be a benefit to both players and developers.</p>","arenanet":false}]}
