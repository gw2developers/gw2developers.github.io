I recently tested the Star Swarm Stress Test and noticed that 8000 ships on screen at once didn’t drop me below 30FPS. It would be PERFECT for those who struggle running World vs World or Living World Content and it’s soon to be Open Source so no licencing fees to Mr. AMD. It would also help with the users of low-end or 8-Core CPU’s as it reduces the effects of bottlenecking (which anyone with an AMD 8-Core can tell you exists within the game). Hope you consider the idea!</p>","arenanet":false}]}
