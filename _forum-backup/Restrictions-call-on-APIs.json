You can request up to 200 resources at once. Alternatively, you could use /v2/items?page_size=200&amp;page=N to pull <strong>all</strong> the item data (and /v2/recipes?page_size=200&amp;page=N to pull <strong>all</strong> the recipe data) and it’d probably be less network overhead.</p>\n<p>Ultimately, it doesn’t make that big of a difference performance-wise on our side, so I’m not too concerned about it.
