But it’s no good programming style to flood the api. Try to cache the data as long as it is possible and fetch the data as often as it’s necessary :-).  Keep in mind, that an API-Call uses some time (to connect, fetch, disconnect, etc.) and try to use some API-specific options (e.g. ids=all and pagination) to call the api less often.</p>\n<p>Greetings<br>\nChris</p>","arenanet":false},{"pubDate":"2016-02-03T08:58:51.000Z","guid":"http://forum-en.guildwars2.com/forum/community/api/Frequency-of-queries/5966792","author":"Kyle Corver.1897","body":"\n<p>Hi guys,</p>\n<p>I have a question regarding the number of queries, that can be send to the API to obtain Information. My goal is to write an application that frequently updates the trading post data (price, numoffers) etc. of a specific list of items.</p>\n<p>Now I want to know if there is a limitation to the number of queries that are allowed to send to the API (per hour/minute/etc.). I don’t want my IP to get banned for spam or similar ^^</p>\n<p>Regards</p>\n<p>Kyle</p>","arenanet":false}]}
