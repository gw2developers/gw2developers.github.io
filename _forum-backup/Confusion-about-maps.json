I pointed that out once but didn’t have time yet to do more investigation and write it up in a GitHub issue. <br>\nAnother example might be the wrong region for several maps over here: <a href=\"https://api.guildwars2.com/v2/continents/1/floors/1/regions/8\">https://api.guildwars2.com/v2/continents/1/floors/1/regions/8</a> <br>\nLots of them are actually in Tarnished coast. It seems like the mappers thought “oh c’mon, let’s just throw all those new instances into region 8. YOLO!”.<br>\nI mean, the continents API is cool to draw any map once you know where they’re hidden; what i miss is an endpoint which allows us to draw clean overview maps for both continents.
