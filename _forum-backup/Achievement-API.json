Since Mastery Points will have a lot in common with Achievement Points (account bound, usually not repeatable, tied to an place/activity) the syntax for pulling Mastery Points can probably be very similar. But that is probably something for after the Achievement API is online (and also for when we are closer to the launch of HoT).</p>","arenanet":false},{"pubDate":"2015-05-14T18:33:53.000Z","guid":"http://forum-en.guildwars2.com/forum/community/api/Achievement-API/5065546","author":"Lawton Campbell.8517","body":"\n<p>Someoneâ€™s already drafted <a href=\"https://github.com/arenanet/api-cdi/pull/23\">a proposal for an achievement API</a>.
