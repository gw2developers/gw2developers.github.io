This being an AutoIt program, you definitely don’t need a setup as the compiled versions are meant to be run with just the .exe</p>\n<p>@others discussing this topic</p>\n<p>I feel that with open source programs the chance is much lower that it will contain trojans etc, especially if they’ve been out for a while and it has acquired a sizable amount of users or at least people discussing the program.  The more people actively using or discussing said program, the higher the chance of having some knowledgeable people amongst them that will have checked the source code.</p>\n<p>There’s never a guarantee without going through the source code yourself and compiling it, but there are definitely some factors that make it seem more likely to be ‘legit’. Then there are of course always cases such as the ‘bitcoin mining malware incident’ from sources most would think be trustworthy. Such is life, you can’t trust everyone, but sometimes you do have to trust and hope for the best.</p>\n<p>In general if you don’t have any programming savvy yourself, try and look out for these sort of things:<br>\n-open source (even though you yourself can’t read it)<br>\n-trustworthy dev (somebody with a good standing in a community and a lot of activity there has more to lose)<br>\n-many users / downloads<br>\n-long discussion thread (actually read it all if feasible; at least try to read the latest posts)<br>\n-try and find information from different sources (think forums / websites)</p>\n<p>In general principle: do your research. I’ve come across some terrible cases where somebody posted a certain program that just reeked of being ridden with malware (posted by a new member, no open source, claiming impossible things in a format common to previous bad programs). The following thread consisted of many posts by knowledgeable people with good standing in the community claiming it was malware. After a day or two somebody showed the method used to pack the said malware and the code within the program that was responsible for sending on account information. Screenshots of the email account being used for collecting the account information including several compromised accounts (not the exact details) were also shown. Then the next few posts in the thread were all from new users still downloading it and complaining it wasn’t doing what was promised.</p>\n<p>In general it is better to err on the side of caution and if none of the above listed things look very promising, just don’t rush to download it and give it some time until you feel confident either way.</p>","arenanet":false},{"pubDate":"2013-05-27T17:05:18.000Z","guid":"http://forum-en.guildwars2.com/forum/community/api/I-got-a-Trojan/2100348","author":"DerRAVEN.3254","body":"\n<p>You’re sure, that that overlay is a trojan?
