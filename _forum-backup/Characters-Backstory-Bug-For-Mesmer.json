The backstory (answer) ids being provided for Mesmers (esp. the final id which is the profession answer/question) is actually the answer/question for Revenants.  I have seen this error for two different Mesmers on two different accounts, and both get the answer/question for Revenant “Blindfold” instead of the correct Mesmer profession answer/question.</p>","arenanet":false}]}
