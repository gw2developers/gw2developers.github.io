It’s not really a big deal in the end, though. 5s isn’t going to make or break a choice to head to a certain camp or tower. ;P</p>\n<p>In any case, this plug-in is absolutely incredible.

I know it’s because you use the same image than the ingame map, but it waste some space on screen, and it’s a bit problematic when you display all 4</p>\n<p>- could you do “variations” of the overlay where it grows (or reduce) differently than  now ?<br>\nNow it’s always starting from top left and growing towards bottom right. I put it on the right side of y screen, meaning zoning it out grow it out of the screen, and zooming it in reduce it towards the middle of the screen instead of keeping it “docked” on the right side of the screen.<br>\nNothing major, but would be nice to see a change.</p>\n<p>- Now, another thing i think you’ve got a major problem somewhere in your code with how you get objectives names/positions.</p>\n<p>First week it worked flawlessly, it was accurate, but since reset everything is “off”. Took me a bit of time but i got it, the timers are “right” … but not displayed in the right place.</p>\n<p>I’m on RoS so this week it’s RoS/Bt/FoW (last week it was RoS/Fow/Bt), and it’s shuffled :</p>\n<p>Right now in home bl we have timers on faithleap and waterlowalands camps (ours and bt’s owned), your overlay show the timers on Sunnyhill and Foghaven respectively, but with the longer timer on the bt owned Foghaven instead when the higher timer should be on a RoS owned camp south.</p>\n<p>I restarted the overlay multiple times, i resintalled it, it doesn’t change a thing, and since the timers are good i think the problem is elsewhere (ie : who cap what objective at what time, and the name of objectives).</p>\n<p>I hope you can fix it quickly, i liked your overlay.<img src=\"/include/images/smilies/wink.png\"></p>","arenanet":false},{"pubDate":"2014-08-22T19:44:30.000Z","guid":"http://forum-en.guildwars2.com/forum/community/api/World-vs-World-Map-Overlay-in-Rainmeter/4321491","author":"Sol Solus.3167","body":"\n<p>A WvW map in <a href=\"http://rainmeter.net/\">Rainmeter</a> that can be used as a transparent overlay or blown up for a secondary display.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://fc00.deviantart.net/fs70/f/2014/234/1/3/guild_wars_2_world_vs_world_map_overlay_by_killall_q-d7w7vhs.jpg\">Preview</a> | <a href=\"http://killall-q.deviantart.com/art/Guild-Wars-2-World-vs-World-Map-Overlay-477378352\">Download</a></p>\n<p><strong>Features</strong></p>\n<ul>\n\t<li>Scale from postage stamp size to 4K</li>\n\t<li>Display any one or all maps</li>\n\t<li>Minimize to scoreboard</li>\n\t<li>Righteous Indignation and siege decay timers</li>\n\t<li>RI tracked regardless of displayed map</li>\n\t<li>Tooltips with guild names</li>\n\t<li>Update every 5 seconds</li>\n\t<li>Pause updates after 30 minutes idle</li>\n\t<li>Autoset self to topmost when GW2 is running</li>\n\t<li>High-res maps and objective icons</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Usage</strong></p>\n<ul>\n\t<li>GW2’s display resolution must be set to “<strong>Windowed Fullscreen</strong>” or “<strong>Window</strong>”.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n\t<li>Scroll to zoom.</li>\n\t<li>Click scores for map select menu.</li>\n\t<li>Double-click scores to toggle minimize.</li>\n\t<li>Click objectives to copy waypoints/points of interest and RI times.</li>\n\t<li>Middle-click objectives to set siege decay timers.</li>\n\t<li>Access world select in right-click menu.</li>\n\t<li>After weekly WvW reset, right-click menu -&gt; “Refresh skin” to retrieve the new match up.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>CHANGELOG</p>\n<p>[2015.02.19]<br>\n- Fixed to accommodate changes in API formatting.</p>\n<p>[2015.01.16]<br>\n- Fixed map selection menu behavior on toggling minimize.</p>\n<p>[2015.01.14]<br>\n- Fixed and future proofed API parsing.</p>\n<p>[2014.09.16]<br>\n- Copy objective waypoint only if owned, otherwise copy PoI.</p>\n<p>[2014.09.15]<br>\n- Added RI timer copy to clipboard.<br>\n- Optimized scaling performance.</p>\n<p>[2014.09.09]<br>\n- Refocus GW2 on interaction.</p>\n<p>[2014.08.30]<br>\n- Fixed ownership errors while bloodlust unclaimed.</p>","arenanet":false}]}
