But if I call a single ID, <a href=\"https://api.guildwars2.com/v2/currencies/1\">https://api.guildwars2.com/v2/currencies/1</a>, then I can call .id, or .name, and get a value I expect, i.e. 1 or .id, coin for .name.  I expected to get an array of items, that doesn’t seem to be the case.   XXX<sup class=\"footnote\"><a href=\"#fn1\">1</a></sup>.name returns undefined.  I’m obviously missing something, but I don’t know what.  I’m new to this, so that’s likely, but I have programming knowledge, so I understand the concepts of arrays and objects.</p>","arenanet":false}]}
