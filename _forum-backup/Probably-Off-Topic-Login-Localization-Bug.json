And feel free to move this topic to the bug-board).</p>\n<p>I think ANet somehow messed up the localization on the webservers.</p>\n<p>Lately the launcher is acting very strange. I’m playing GW2 with the text-language set to german and audio-language set to english. Because of this, the login-form <strong>should</strong> be german but lately something strange is happening. When i start the launcher, the <strong>english</strong> form is displayed for a few seconds (2-3s) and then it gets swapped for the german form. Funny thing is: if i enter my username+password before the form is swapped out, instead of displaying the 2-factor form, it still just displays the german form and i have to enter my login-data again.</p>\n<p>Pretty much since this is happening, I’m also getting a lot of errors after submitting my username+password that the login-servers could not be reached.</p>\n<p>I talked to a few people and they are experiencing exactly the same problems.</p>\n<p>So I’m wondering if ANet has changed the way the webservers handle the localized forms and messed something up while doing so…</p>\n<p><strong>Edit</strong>: I added some screenshots which show that the Launcher is using german in the beginning, then switching to englisch and then switching to german again.</p>","arenanet":false}]}
