It could technically return the other stats, but computing all that is a bit difficult so it doesn’t currently.</p>\n<p>Items with chosen stats are <a href=\"https://github.com/arenanet/api-cdi/issues/177\">a known issue</a>. There’s currently no way to tell that an item has chose-able stats, nor can you determine via API which stats are currently selected.

Why can’t I get character’s stats ie HP, power, defense, vitality etc? And for some weapons/armour which I can chose the stats when I get them in game, I can’t get theirs. Probably because I lookup the item via items endpoint and stats are not there for weapons when I can chose them in game.</p>","arenanet":false}]}
