The overlay will open similar to steam overlay on pressing a hotkey and its purpose is simply to provide the user wish some useful information such as current events in his/her area, a more customized auction house search and an in-game web browser.<br>\nMy question now is regarding the method of creating the actual interface. My basic idea was to detour the EndScene using ether a custom d3d9.dll og using a global hook (something in the direction of SetWindowsHookEx). But to do this I would interfere with the actual game, although i’m not changing the game itself. <br>\nAm I allowed to do such a thing or do I need to find a different solution like a “Xorg-ish” kind of approach aka creating another window which is getting focus on hotkey.</p>","arenanet":false}]}
