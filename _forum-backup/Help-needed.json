I really like Guild Wars (2) and I hope I could make some contribution to it.</p>\n<p>So I was wondering: Are there still things that need to be done that I can do? I have knowledge in programming with C++, Java and the standard webdevelopment skills. (HTML5, CSS, Javascript, and some PHP) But I also wouldn’t mind writing documentation or other things.</p>\n<p>I have 3 weeks of vacation from university so there is plenty of time.<br>\nI hope you guys know something I can assist with!</p>\n<p>Have a nice week everyone!,</p>\n<p>Strategist</p>","arenanet":false}]}
