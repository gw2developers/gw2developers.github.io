Most services that offer IRC or XMPP access do that because they use those as their underlying backbone. Twitch and Facebook/Google Talk comes to mind here. But with Facebook/Google you can also see where this leads: Their services moved away from the old backends and they had to build gateways for backward compability. Facebook already ditched that and Google lets the gateway rot until everyone is glad when they pull the plug.</p>\n<p>Assuming Guild Wars 2 is not using an XMPP or IRC server internally, it would start out as a gateway, with all the horrible choices about how to represent things in that protocoll. And while one could hope that lots of clients would work out of the box, a lot will have their problems because of some tiny unwritten or hard to find rules between all those RFC, XEP and stuff that’s always copied from other clients implementations.</p>\n<p>Ironically, the first thing to do would be to implement a proper API first and then create a gateway around it. So the best choice would be to omit the gateway building part, make an own API with whatever technology that’s preferred and let the community do the rest. If there’s demand, there will be lots of things popping up: libpurple plugins, plugins for other multi chat clients, Jabber transports, IRC gateways/bitlbee plugins and of cause clients that directly use the API.</p>","arenanet":false},{"pubDate":"2015-06-26T01:29:30.000Z","guid":"http://forum-en.guildwars2.com/forum/community/api/API-CDI-2015/5212748","author":"zyph.9426","body":"\n<blockquote><div class=\"citey\"><cite title=\"Posted on February 21 2015 10:43AM\"><a href=\"/forum/community/api/API-CDI-2015/4815827\">Ravenmoon.5318:</a></cite></div><div class=\"quotey\"><blockquote><div class=\"citey\"><cite title=\"Posted on February 20 2015 06:36PM\"><a href=\"/forum/community/api/API-CDI-2015/4813732\">Lawton Campbell.8517:</a></cite></div><div class=\"quotey\"><blockquote><div class=\"citey\"><cite title=\"Posted on February 20 2015 09:14AM\"><a href=\"/forum/community/api/API-CDI-2015/4812509\">DeviantShark.6548:</a></cite></div><div class=\"quotey\"><p>With the possibility of authentication there ought to be some guild-roster-api, but i don’t know how this should be implemented.

With possible values like: city, dungeon, personal_story, living_story, instance, pvp, wvw. Or at least a way to separate instances from “normal” maps.</p>\n<p>My reasoning is that, previously, with /v1/map_names.json, it would only return the major maps plus some random maps like the Crown Pavillion. This way I could “easily” identify which maps are actually maps and not instances. Granted, I was still missing the cities, but I could add those ids manually without much effort. However, at some day in the past (don’t know when), that endpoint got changed to include every map. So, <a href=\"http://archomeda.github.io/gw2map/\">my nice effort to get the major map boundaries</a> is now a major disaster as I don’t know an automated way to separate maps by type other than this non-working workaround.</p>\n<p>Also, now that I see this, I’ve got another question. Why are most instances located in Steamspur Mountains instead of their correct respective region? For example, map <a href=\"https://api.guildwars2.com/v2/maps/1006\">1006 – Foefire Cleansing</a> is clearly an instance from living story season 2 and is located in <a href=\"https://api.guildwars2.com/v2/maps/19\">Plains of Ashford – Ascalon</a>, yet it is tagged as Steamspur Mountains.</p>\n<p>Also, using brackets in link titles doesn’t work on the forums apparently, had to resort to use dashes instead… <img src=\"/include/images/smilies/sad.png\"></p>","arenanet":false},{"pubDate":"2015-03-16T20:46:32.000Z","guid":"http://forum-en.guildwars2.com/forum/community/api/API-CDI-2015/4884652","author":"Lawton Campbell.8517","body":"\n<blockquote><div class=\"citey\"><cite title=\"Posted on March 16 2015 07:52PM\"><a href=\"/forum/community/api/API-CDI-2015/4884151\">Wilz.8461:</a></cite></div><div class=\"quotey\"><ul>\n\t<li>Would it be possible to have the list of ingredients on items that can be crafted, even Mystic forge recipes like legendaries or exotic weapons (i.e infinite light, mjolnir, etc…) ?<br>\nThis information is on the wiki but not in the API.</li>\n</ul></div></blockquote>\n<p>Not in the forseeable future.
