I do not know exactly how much data is required for the HTTP calls but using the method by Think, the url now returns 1 line which is pretty good. But I agree with Healix that the HTTP calls will likely buff up the data used which makes this concept not feasible due to the many calls required.</p>\n<p>As for making my own API, etc, I’m afraid that is also not feasible for my app as I do not have a server to pull and perform this consolidation of data. If I were to perform it on the user’s device (Android App), it will still defeat the objective of trying to reduce data usage.</p>\n<p>But thanks very much for the information!</p>","arenanet":false},{"pubDate":"2013-06-01T10:55:48.000Z","guid":"http://forum-en.guildwars2.com/forum/community/api/Question-on-Using-the-Events-API/2134333","author":"Healix.5819","body":"\n<p>Unfortunately, they don’t support something like event_ids=1,2,3. Instead, you’ll have to query each event individually. Depending on how many events you’re tracking and how often, individual queries will most likely be more efficient. Unfortunately though, since the responses are quite small, the http headers end up being just as big as the response data, meaning if they did support something like multiple ids, you could cut the data usage in half.</p>\n<p>If you’re trying to request as little data as possible, the most efficient method would be to make your own API that collects data, which you then request from. By doing this, you can turn 100 or so calls at a cost of ~15KB down to 1 call at a cost of a few hundred bytes.</p>","arenanet":false},{"pubDate":"2013-06-01T10:03:33.000Z","guid":"http://forum-en.guildwars2.com/forum/community/api/Question-on-Using-the-Events-API/2134156","author":"Think.8042","body":"\n<p>Query string parameters are seperated by &amp; and are AND-ed to filter your results.</p>\n<p>What you want is probably (only show a single event from a single world):<br>\n<a href=\"https://api.guildwars2.com/v1/events.json?world_id=1004&event_id=9AA133DC-F630-4A0E-BB5D-EE34A2B306C2\">https://api.guildwars2.com/v1/events.json?world_id=1004&amp;event_id=9AA133DC-F630-4A0E-BB5D-EE34A2B306C2</a></p>\n<p>Currently, you can’t supply multiple IDs of any type to get the status of a list of events from the API at once.</p>","arenanet":false},{"pubDate":"2013-06-01T09:49:29.000Z","guid":"http://forum-en.guildwars2.com/forum/community/api/Question-on-Using-the-Events-API/2134107","author":"ScArZ.4953","body":"\n<p>Hi, I have made a android app to use the api. The app can be found in google play by searching for “GW2 Event Timer”.
