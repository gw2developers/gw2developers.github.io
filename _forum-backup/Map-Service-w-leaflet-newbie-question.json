I’m taking the sample given here <a href=\"http://jsfiddle.net/cliff/CRRGC/\">http://jsfiddle.net/cliff/CRRGC/</a> as a base. However when I move the code into my own files, I’m seeing some different behavior than on the jsfiddle.</p>\n<p>The biggest thing I’m seeing is I’m able to zoom out far past the map, although the setMaxBounds is set. If I zoom out past the map size it starts bouncing around the browser. Anyone seen this before?</p>\n<p>Is this because I would need to define my own southwest/northeast bounds? Literally all I’ve done is copied the code from the jsfiddle into my own html/js files. Thanks for any suggestions.</p>","arenanet":false}]}
