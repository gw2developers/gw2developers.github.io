I have a static php version as well that works in all browsers.  The issue only comes up when you move to javascript, for the reason mentioned by the post under yours.  I’m looking for a workaround, as I’d much rather continue the javascript version since it auto updates the data without having to refresh the page (something that cannot be done with php alone).<br>\nThank you for your response though<img src=\"/include/images/smilies/smile.png\"></p>\n<blockquote><div class=\"citey\"><cite title=\"Posted on June 02 2013 03:30PM\"><a href=\"/forum/community/api/Realtime-Dragon-Event-Status-Script/2141007\">Healix.5819:</a></cite></div><div class=\"quotey\"><blockquote><div class=\"citey\"><cite title=\"Posted on June 02 2013 02:43AM\"><a href=\"/forum/community/api/Realtime-Dragon-Event-Status-Script/2138515\">D W.5179:</a></cite></div><div class=\"quotey\"><p>The example fiddle in OP does not work in IE (at least 9, likely 8 as well).</p></div></blockquote>\n<p>That’s because support wasn’t fully added until IE10. <a href=\"http://blogs.msdn.com/b/ieinternals/archive/2010/05/13/xdomainrequest-restrictions-limitations-and-workarounds.aspx\">http://blogs.msdn.com/b/ieinternals/archive/2010/05/13/xdomainrequest-restrictions-limitations-and-workarounds.aspx</a></p></div></blockquote>\n<p>Well that explains it… Man, I hate IE lol.<br>\nSo looks like only IE10 supports CORS and for IE8/9 I would need to build a postMessage proxy.
