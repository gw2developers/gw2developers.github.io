Instead what happens is you log in to a page provided by ANet using a special link (which tells ANet what permissions are being requested, and where to return what’s called an access token) which then asks if you want to allow access for this application, and also tells you which permissions you’re giving (i.e. Character, Account, Offline, etc – these are the scopes or permissions that you want the application to have). If you never allow an application to use a particular scope (or revoke access) then the app cannot access that data. After allowing the application access, they get returned an access token to retrieve data (and a refresh token if you allowed the Offline scope, so they can get new access tokens when the old one expires.)
