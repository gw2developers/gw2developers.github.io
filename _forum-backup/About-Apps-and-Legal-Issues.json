I plan on getting data from gw2 API. and of Course ill be using Images from GW2 Art.<br>\nMy question is: Android app will be free with some “paid improvements”, DO I HAVE to ask permission to ANET to use their ART ICONS or their API? do i have to pay them a % of earnings (if i have any)? I dont wanna work and then get issues with ANET (legal).<br>\nOr just to avoid all that make the app free with ADS?<br>\nEveryone can answer but i would be nice if some from ANET could send me into the correct direction to get answers.</p>\n<p>Thanks for your time Community.</p>","arenanet":false}]}
