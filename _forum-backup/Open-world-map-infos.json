It is true that “Magic Sucks” is only accessible as part of the story, but it IS actually a map. It lies just north of Rata Sum, and has a single sector labeled “Advanced Metamystics Lab”. Rata Sum has a portal that leads to the map, but it is disabled for some reason.</p>\n<p>The only other map on floor 0 without an entrance is “Readings On the Rise”. It has a single sector labeled “Dynamics Union”, which is on the second level of Rata Sum.</p>\n<p>So what do these have in common? They’re both story instances that start in Rata Sum. What does that mean?
