For example the “Frozen Maw event”<a href=\"http://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Protect_Scholar_Brogun_as_he_investigates_the_grawl_tribe\">http://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Protect_Scholar_Brogun_as_he_investigates_the_grawl_tribe</a> is currently being reported as “active” on Elona Reach, although in-game the “Maw is quiet”. This makes event timers a bit useless if you don’t know if you can trust the results or not.</p>","arenanet":false}]}
