And I know that a game cannot please everyone. That is why I’m going to ask for guild changes!</p>\n<p>So the thing is, me and my guild wanted to create very different kind of ranking system, almost unique. But the guild options for some part of the ranking isn’t enough! So I’m going to just shoot all the changes instead of writting a huge text about it!</p>\n<p>-Increase the number of possible ranks( the maximum right now is 10)<br>\n-Add a color option to the ‘’rank Icons’‘, or I noticed the ’’Edit Icon’’ under these icons, maybe you could make that clicklable so we can access a panel of options? Oh and by colors, the most basic ones would probably be enough, unless you want to go at it and give a bunch!<br>\n-Maybe add in the guild settings a ‘’Log in/out notification’’ for when guild members log in or out!</p>\n<p>And that’s pretty much it that I can think of for now! If you thought those were good ideas, please let me know! I would love to know your ideas/opinions on this also!</p>\n<p>Thank you for your time!</p>","arenanet":false}]}
