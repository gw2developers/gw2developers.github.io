Not all third party apps are well written and some are just too spammy and it can be hard to tell the difference between a poorly written app and a DOS attack.</p>\n<p>I can understand why they added flooding protection as they need to preserve a minimum level of responsiveness for the TP experience for the rest of the players and since third party apps hit the same TP server as the game clients, it makes sense for them to setup flooding protection.  This can easily be mitigated in the app code through some caching and cleverer programming otherwise, simply add some sleeps.</p>\n<p>I would have preferred it if they return a 503 status code instead with a Retry-After information in their response header though but whatever.</p>","arenanet":false},{"pubDate":"2013-09-02T17:50:17.000Z","guid":"http://forum-en.guildwars2.com/forum/community/api/Trading-Post-API-Issues/2754647","author":"Samuirai.4561","body":"\n<p>I didn’t say that.
