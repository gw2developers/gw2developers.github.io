These are map ids we’re talking about. As long as the Alpine Borderlands are active, you can assume they are staying the same. But the Desert Borderlands have different ids since they are completely different maps. For example, from my WvW stress test time, I could figure out with the Mumble API that the Red Desert Borderlands is 1069, and the Green Desert Borderlands is 1087. No clue about the Blue one, since that one was inactive.</p>\n<p>There is another way that’s a bit more fixed, but this only applies if you’re using the Mumble API. This API contains a mapType value that is different depending on where you are: EB = 9, Blue BL = 10, Green BL = 11, Red BL = 12, Obsidian Sanctum = 14, EotM = 15. And these values were the same in the Desert Borderlands.
