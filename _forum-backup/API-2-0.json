I’ve been working with the API almost every day over the last few months, and I’m sure there are others like me. We know exactly what we want, and we’d love to implement it ourselves if given the opportunity. I’m thinking you could make parts of your SDK publicly available, just enough for us to try and reduce the backlog for v2 and submit the results as patches.</p>","arenanet":false},{"pubDate":"2014-03-12T01:29:12.000Z","guid":"http://forum-en.guildwars2.com/forum/community/api/API-2-0/3750946","author":"Killer Rhino.6794","body":"\n<blockquote><div class=\"citey\"><cite title=\"Posted on March 11 2014 11:52PM\"><a href=\"/forum/community/api/API-2-0/3750611\">Stefan Larimore.6872:</a></cite></div><div class=\"quotey\"><p>Hi all.
