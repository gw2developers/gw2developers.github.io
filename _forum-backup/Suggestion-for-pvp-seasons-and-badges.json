Is it only season 4 that has the rating, or do earlier seasons also have it? I think we’ve always tracked an internal MMR for matchmaking, but it wasn’t exposed via API until we started displaying the value in-game. The current implementation will emit a rating/decay value if it exists in the backend server, so I guess those old previously internal MMRs are visible.</p>\n<p>I’ll add a note to the docs.</p>","arenanet":true},{"pubDate":"2017-05-22T21:01:48.000Z","guid":"http://forum-en.guildwars2.com/forum/community/api/Suggestion-for-pvp-seasons-and-badges/6596744","author":"Elfo Bianco.3786","body":"\n<blockquote><div class=\"citey\"><cite title=\"Posted on May 22 2017 05:06PM\"><a href=\"/forum/community/api/Suggestion-for-pvp-seasons-and-badges/6596462\">Lawton Campbell.8517:</a></cite></div><div class=\"quotey\"><p>Huh, the decay value should be in there; I’ll try to get that fixed. <a href=\"https://github.com/arenanet/api-cdi/issues/530\">Tracking issue</a>.</p></div></blockquote>\n<p>I still don’t understand.

From API:2/pvp/standings I get my current rating for each season and nothing more.</p>\n<p><strong>(if it is possible)</strong> I’m asking for an additional object in API:2/pvp/seasons that gives info about all ranks for each season. Something like:</p>\n<p>“league_ranks”:<br>\n[<br>\n{<br>\n“name”:“Gold”, <strong><em>//or “Diamond” or “Amber” or “Platinum” …</em></strong><br>\n“badge_icon”:“<strong><em>(url to the icon)</em></strong>”,<br>\n“tiers”: [1351,1451,1551] <strong><em>//for seasons 1-4 this is an array with length=1 to  compare to “total_points” instead of “rating” from API:2/pvp/standings</em></strong><br>\n},<br>\n…<br>\n]</p>\n<p>In a different way, you could add an object “league_ranks”: [<strong><em>(rank ids)</em></strong>] with only ids that we get from a new API (something like API:2/pvp/badges), to reduce data repetition with similar seasons. This way will cost at least 1 more request, but maybe it is the best option<img src=\"/include/images/smilies/smile.png\"></p>\n<p>Now a suggetion for the existing API:2/pvp/standings, the object “best” (that returns info only about division) should be optional. In a better way “best” should be null if “current” is exactly the best. To me it would happen even for seasons 1-4 and with the actual rules for seasons 5+ “best” division is “current” division.<br>\nWithout making these changes server-side and leaving this work to the app that uses API:2/pvp/standings would become interesting the best rating in “best” object that is actually missing for seasons 5+.<br>\nFor a better solution, all the changes together<img src=\"/include/images/smilies/colondee.png\"></p>","arenanet":false}]}
