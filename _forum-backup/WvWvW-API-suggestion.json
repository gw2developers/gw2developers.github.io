Comparing world population “high” vs “medium” doesn’t reveal Asian and European guilds covering wee hours for US worlds.</p>\n<p>A 2nd suggestion: Instrumenting world population at a daily granularity. This would allow charting population vs active WvW players. I suspect there are huge migrations every time WvW rules change.</p>\n<p>From my research over the last 6 months:<br>\n1) Wins are NOT determined by positive kills : deaths ratio.  <br>\n2) When the kills plus deaths sum is greater than other worlds then you win.<br>\nThe results point to online player hours around the clock.</p>\n<p>Why am I researching this? Because I used to love WvW and would like to see it flourish. Unfortunately, skirmish mode settles the week’s contest by Sunday. No point in playing because you can’t catch up. Yes I instrumented this too.</p>\n<p>I know skirmishes were are an attempt to make things more balanced but instead it has lead to huge population shifts. Since “skirmish” started, loads of money has been spent by hundreds of players on switching worlds. That is not sustainable game design for the future.</p>\n<p>Thanks for reading,<br>\nOrc</p>","arenanet":false}]}
