So, i had a few ideas and after watching what API provides – NONE of them can be made. I can’t even start – there’s nothing for me.</p>\n<p>First ideas – help our guild managers and other guilds by providing tools to control specific guild events, control active and non-active players, watch what players play PVE/PVP and what they’re doing and guide new players, connecting people by their in-game interests. And it’s just “first brainstorm”.</p>\n<p>It’s so confusing to me – you’re even making contest for it – yet almost nothing can be done using tools you provide. The question is – will there be huge improvements to API in near future?</p>\n<p>EDIT: <br>\nExample of app that i would like to appear:<br>\nTool that watches the most active players in guild by category (for example, TOP5 Ascalon figthers), management of rewards.<br>\nAnother example:<br>\nSynchronization code for web application to display game profile (our guild members should maintain this manually).</p>","arenanet":false}]}
