Most skins do conform to having one obvious set name. However, most skins were also part of at least two sets – one for PvE, and one for PvP. Membership in both sets was not always guaranteed. For example, the Bandit weapons overlap with Makeshift weapons, but Makeshift Spear has no PvE counterpart and remains named Makeshift instead of Bandit.</p>\n<p>2. Flame weapons did not include SteamFire until SteamFire was renamed a few months ago, even though they shared obvious visual similarities.</p>\n<p>3.

This test did not take into account caching already “known” data and was just a brute force test of the speed/time to download data from this API (i.e. like if this was a first time downloading from the API).</p>\n<p>My connection is a dedicated business DSL with a 45 Mbps down / 10 Mbps up.</p>\n<p>And to the person (sorry I forgot the name as I write this) that replied to my thought about searching items by name – yea you would still potentially receive a large amount of items to have to iterate through; however, it would still be a much smaller subset of data, more quicker, and more efficient than the current method of having to search through all 7.7k recipes (and the outputs, etc.) or 30k+ items to locate each item with “rabid.”  Even 200 items with “rabid” is less than having to iterate through the entire recipes and its structure or the items.</p>\n<p>If the APIs functioned a lot more like the Trading Post does in game, that would be the improvement.  We should have URL parameters on the APIs that allow for things such as, “?item_name=rabid”, “?item_level=80”, “?item_rarity=legendary”, “?item_type=armor”, etc.; that allows us to retrieve only a subset of the data instead of having to iterate through the entire collection.  Honestly, I’m assuming there’s an SQL database driving the back-end of the API, so handling these sorts of requests would minimal additional load on the servers.

These are largely motivated by the fact that mobile applications really to keep data from the API (items, recipes, etc.) stored locally in a database. This is for a number of reasons.</p>\n<p>1.  Mobile applications should really be usable without a network connection.  That’s pretty much becoming a standard requirement for apps these days.</p>\n<p>2. Functionality I’m implementing would prohibitively expensive in terms of network turnaround.  Right now as I’m testing it takes almost 20 minutes to download full item detail for the ~30k items in the game.  That’s not even including images, or the ~6k recipes  to make them.  So advanced search capabilities (filtering by rarity for example) would be impossible without the full item set requires all the data if there’s no search API.</p>\n<p>3. Hitting your servers for information that rarely (if ever) changes is an unnecessary load on your infrastructure.  Reducing the number of requests would simply make the service faster for everyone and save you infrastructure costs.  Given the search example, I can do search much faster and efficiently with local data (and with better functionality).</p>\n<p>4. Mobile applications should able query for changed data (item details, for example) periodically so that we don’t have to re-seed the local database and release an app update.  User’s simply aren’t going to sit around for 20 minutes while the app reloads everything and sees what changed and that’s the only option right now.</p>\n<p>So, given all that, here are my suggestions.</p>\n<p>1. First off, for v2 of the API I would suggest significant changes to the endpoints, response formats, etc. It would make use of the API much clearer, reduce the number of endpoints, and make applications more robust.  Feel free to PM me if you want to talk about that.</p>\n<p>2. Any API endpoint that returns a large number of IDs that require another endpoint call for the actual object detail (items for example) really needs to have a variant that returns <strong>all</strong> of the detail for the items in one response.  Having to do 30k item detail endpoint calls must be crushing your servers and certainly not performing well for application users considering it takes 20 minutes to download.</p>\n<p>3. Add a <em>changedSince</em> query parameter that specifies returning only ids/objects that have changed since a certain time.  Unfortunately there’s no standard URL-friendly format.  I’d suggest YYYY-MM-DD in UTC.  If your database doesn’t keep track of when an item is updated, you might want to try to convince your DBA’s to add one.  It’s a pretty standard content management feature.</p>\n<p>4. Add an endpoint that returns an array of all the IDs/signatures that are valid for the render service.  Add a <em>changedSince</em> parameter as well.  If that’s not feasible, add it to the render endpoint call and return an empty document to avoid the ~6k download   and the need to compare it on the client side to the stored asset.</p>\n<p>Sorry for the wall of text.  I think that’s about it for now.  These features would make mobile developers’ lives much easier and a much better experience for end-users.</p>\n<p>Keep up the good work.</p>","arenanet":false},{"pubDate":"2013-09-16T22:27:55.000Z","guid":"http://forum-en.guildwars2.com/forum/community/api/API-Suggestion-Items-Recipes-and-Crafting/2850784","author":"nino.3946","body":"\n<blockquote><div class=\"citey\"><cite title=\"Posted on May 23 2013 07:10AM\"><a href=\"/forum/community/api/Item-Recipe-API-suggestions/2077119\">DarkSpirit.7046:</a></cite></div><div class=\"quotey\"><p>You would have to match the output_item_id from the recipe list.</p>\n<p>But that would mean you have to download all recipe_details of each recipe to search for the output_item_id of the item that you need to craft.
