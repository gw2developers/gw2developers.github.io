Good job!  Here’s a few things I noticed:</p>\n<p>Based on the background ID numbering, you used my original texture archive to generate your SVGs.  <a href=\"https://forum-en.guildwars2.com/members/Moturdrn-2837\">Moturdrn</a> discovered that background ID 9 doesn’t exist, so everything 9 and up needs to be incremented by 1 (such that the last background is 28).</p>\n<p>I think you might have an error in the SVG for foreground 44.  I get the three dots and the center of the triskelion, but the outer arms are simply missing.</p>\n<p>An enhancement for the form would be to split the emblem details into separate text boxes, to make it easier to change the individual values and to prevent a user from mucking up the JSON structure.</p>","arenanet":false},{"pubDate":"2013-06-07T08:40:37.000Z","guid":"http://forum-en.guildwars2.com/forum/community/api/JavaScript-Lib-for-Guild-Emblem-generation/2170622","author":"mtodor.2356","body":"\n<p>I can make SVG output or PNG, but I made better solution – Demo Page: <a href=\"http://toro-online.net/gw2emblemdemo/\">http://toro-online.net/gw2emblemdemo/</a></p>\n<p>There is a lot of space for improvement of SVG representations, but that will lead to bigger image definitions in JS → bigger files + longer generation time, etc. I’m making some tweaks (fe. foreground_id=151, there is some kind of color overlapping on quaggan’s belly, also foreground_id=1, there are some shadows on fist).

I’m guessing that, because you’re using SVG approximations of the game textures, it’ll simply have flat colors in the different color zones and ignore any shading/alpha characteristics.  Still, some guilds may prefer a stylized emblem for use on their forum/website instead of a game-accurate representation, and this would be just the thing for them.</p>","arenanet":false},{"pubDate":"2013-06-06T20:07:32.000Z","guid":"http://forum-en.guildwars2.com/forum/community/api/JavaScript-Lib-for-Guild-Emblem-generation/2167677","author":"nightzirch.3126","body":"\n<p>I felt bad that you had made all this work and noone had given you a reply. Then I noticed you posted this today. Still, Ill leave you with a reply.</p>\n<p>Awesome job! I was thinking of making a module on my guild site to display some basic information, like the amount of members and also the guild emblem. Basically, what we get from the API. It quickly hit me that the emblem would be a problem since the official wiki only offers them in black/white/red.</p>\n<p>I still havent tried your script, but I still see how much work lies behind.
