The service is designed to provide tile data in a format compatible with Google Maps, Leaflet, and similar map libraries.</p>\n<p>The basic tile format is described here: <a href=\"https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/v2/overlays#Google_Maps_Coordinates\">https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/v2/overlays#Google_Maps_Coordinates</a></p>\n<p>A tile can be accessed by constructing a URL in the following form:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://tiles.guildwars2.com/{continent_id}/{floor}/{z}/{x}/{y}.jpg\">https://tiles.guildwars2.com/{continent_id}/{floor}/{z}/{x}/{y}.jpg</a></p>\n<p>A list of valid continents and floors can be downloaded using the continents.json API. The map_floor.json API contains useful information like the size of each floor, and bounding rects. The bounding rects define which tiles are available for download, as well as the area of the map that should presented to the user. Tiles outside of the bounding rect are not available for download.</p>\n<p>The map tile service does not currently include map interiors, which are used to provide detailed overlays on some parts of the world map, such as when a character enters a cave.</p>\n<p>Additionally, we’re providing the same fonts used for the in-game map for use on the web. These can be referenced through the following two URLs:</p>\n<ul>\n\t<li><a href=\"https://d1h9a8s8eodvjz.cloudfront.net/fonts/menomonia/08-02-12/menomonia.css\">https://d1h9a8s8eodvjz.cloudfront.net/fonts/menomonia/08-02-12/menomonia.css</a></li>\n\t<li><a href=\"https://d1h9a8s8eodvjz.cloudfront.net/fonts/menomonia/08-02-12/menomonia-italic.css\">https://d1h9a8s8eodvjz.cloudfront.net/fonts/menomonia/08-02-12/menomonia-italic.css</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>It’s allowed and encouraged to link directly to our servers so that you don’t have to download and host the map tiles and fonts.</p>\n<p>A very rudimentary example of using this service is available here: <a href=\"http://jsfiddle.net/cliff/CRRGC/\">http://jsfiddle.net/cliff/CRRGC/</a></p>","arenanet":true},{"pubDate":"2013-05-14T23:01:10.000Z","guid":"http://forum-en.guildwars2.com/forum/community/api/API-Documentation/2028044","author":"Cliff Spradlin.3512","body":"\n<p>Hi,</p>\n<p>Welcome to the API Development forum!</p>\n<p>We’re really excited to share these APIs with you.

Each element contains the world_id, map_id, event_id, and state of an event. The ids can be translated to strings using the APIs listed below. The optional parameters can be used to filter the results to a desired scope of events.</p>\n<p>The possible event states are:</p>\n<ul>\n\t<li>Active – The event is running now</li>\n\t<li>Inactive – The event is not running now</li>\n\t<li>Success – The event has succeeded</li>\n\t<li>Fail – The event has failed</li>\n\t<li>Warmup – The event is waiting for certain criteria to be met before activating</li>\n\t<li>Preparation – The criteria for the event to start have been met, but certain activities (such as an NPC dialogue) have not completed yet.

It returns public data about a guild, including its name, tag, and emblem.</p>\n<p>The emblem data is currently only the text metadata that can be used to compose the emblem. In the future, we may be able to provide the emblem as an image through this API, but that’s not currently possible.</p>\n<p>The colors in emblem data are color IDs that represent an color value. The color IDs can be translated using the color API detailed below. Emblems use the ‘cloth’ material value in the color. We do not currently have an API to resolve foreground_id or background_id to more useful information about the images they represent.</p>\n<hr>\n<hr>\n<p><strong>Map API – BETA</strong></p>\n<hr>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://api.guildwars2.com/v1/continents.json\">https://api.guildwars2.com/v1/continents.json</a></strong></p>\n<p>Optional parameter: lang</p>\n<p>Returns a list of continents, and information about each continent.
