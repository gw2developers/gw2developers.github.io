I’ll do some more investigating, but my current theory is that they’re exceptionally low-volume items (or ones that have never been actually traded) and, for whatever reason, just haven’t made it into the list of items on /v2/items.</p>","arenanet":true},{"pubDate":"2015-06-01T16:37:25.000Z","guid":"http://forum-en.guildwars2.com/forum/community/api/Item-IDs-Omitted-from-API/5114486","author":"Devilsown.9376","body":"\n<p>How long does /v2/items need to update?</p>\n<p>The following Items are part of /v2/commerce/listings but not of /v2/items</p>\n<p>9102, 12709, 29952, 29960, 29964, 29974, 31113, 31120, 31124, 31127, 31130, 31131, 31132, 31133, 31135, 31136, 31137, 31139, 31140, 31144, 31167, 31168, 31169, 31175, 31178, 36687</p>\n<p>A good point to start, much better than searching for not existing recipes.</p>\n<p>I Found id=12709 in the Tradingpost (ingame) “Pot of Pumpkin Bisque”, made and sold it. <br>\n/v2/commerce/listings?id=12709 changed, but /v2/items?id=12709 still shows “text”:“no such id”, over 2h later.</p>","arenanet":false},{"pubDate":"2015-05-28T17:13:04.000Z","guid":"http://forum-en.guildwars2.com/forum/community/api/Item-IDs-Omitted-from-API/5106253","author":"Lawton Campbell.8517","body":"\n<p>There’s an issue on the backlog to fix it, I just haven’t gotten to it yet.</p>\n<p>I mostly need to investigate the implications the change would have in a live environment.</p>","arenanet":true},{"pubDate":"2015-05-28T11:52:13.000Z","guid":"http://forum-en.guildwars2.com/forum/community/api/Item-IDs-Omitted-from-API/5105581","author":"Eearslya.6309","body":"\n<p>Is there any update on this issue?
