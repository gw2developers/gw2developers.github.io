I believe the above is not 100% necessary. I think we got around this problem by detecting the position of the camera, which actually goes into a height that is only obtainable by going into map view. So you can just detect the height of the camera and use that to see if the user has opened his map.</p>\n<blockquote><div class=\"citey\"><cite title=\"Posted on February 28 2015 08:01AM\"><a href=\"/forum/community/api/Suggestion-FoV-in-Mumble/4836705\">aRestless.6213:</a></cite></div><div class=\"quotey\"><p>Even more exciting would be to know the dimensions of the currently shown portion of the map while in map view or even on the mini map – but I think currently my own project would be the only one benefitting from that, so I don’t really think it’s worth the effort.</p>\n<p>Edit: Oh there actually <em>is</em> something that’s missing in the Mumble position data, which is the current floor on the map.

We have so far been unable to do any kind of overlaying over the in-game map because we have no idea where on the map the user is focused, nor do we know how zoomed the user is.

Practically, I don’t forsee adding enough additional functionality to warrant another transport that relays almost entirely the same data.
