However, while searching through the JSON for Tyria Floor 1, I noticed that not only are Dredgehaunt Cliffs, Lornar’s Pass, Blazeridge Steppes, Bloodtide Coast, and Harathi Hinterlands doubled, but their doubles also share the same map ID. This means when I parse the data with JQuery, the initial map data is overwritten by the doubled map data, which is often incomplete. Is there a reason these doubles share the same map IDs, and is it possible to change their map IDs since it makes the previous information inaccessible?</p>","arenanet":false}]}
