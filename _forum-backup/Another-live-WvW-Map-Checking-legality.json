Or is all the tile information strictly 2D coordinates with tile images?

It shows Guild Member positions in real time along with control point timers.</p>\n<p>Here’s a video of it in action with a friend. <br>\n<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TgFF9fEw0o\">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TgFF9fEw0o</a></p>\n<p>Up to this point, I know everything is legal because I’m doing the same as everyone else, just reading the mumble mapping file.</p>\n<p>But here I have added the ability to detect the range on certain things, such as portal.  Now the only thing this does that might be bad is detect keys.  Basically just a key bind on my application is fired when a key is pressed while any application is active.</p>\n<p>Here’s an example of this in action.  The range indicator for portal is laid when I press my portal keybind.  The indicator shows up in the map and remains until I lay the exit portal.  I run to the edge of the indicator, which is max range.<br>\n<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K84EZQiHZcE\">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K84EZQiHZcE</a></p>\n<p>What is the dev team’s opinion on this?
