For that same reason, it may be a better idea to take a different approach. What are you attempting to do that requires the log messages to have separate times?</p>","arenanet":false},{"pubDate":"2016-02-14T21:44:12.000Z","guid":"http://forum-en.guildwars2.com/forum/community/api/Adding-seconds-to-timestamp/5986522","author":"Mirimmar.4103","body":"\n<p>Yeah, I know, but I don’t know where to put it.

But I have a small (for you, but big for me) problem. There can be about 30 events logged in the consol, that will have the same timestamp, becouse the timestamp writes only hours and minutes.</p>\n<p>Can you add the seconds to that timestamp? Or maybe, there is an option to turn them on and I didn’t find it?</p>\n<p>Thx for any reply!</p>","arenanet":false}]}
