I’ve enjoyed it immensely. I am a player from GW and have always enjoyed the guild factor. Personally, I enjoy playing in smaller guilds with more intimate connections. These are usually made up of family and friends that enjoy playing together.</p>\n<p>In the original GW, these was not an issue. We could save money and buy a great Guild Hall. However, with the way things are done with GW2 Guild Halls, we find it more of an issue for smaller guilds to get a Guild Hall.</p>\n<p>I think the method of getting it is great and adds to the value and story of the Guild Hall, however I was wondering – and just as a suggestion or thought – if that perhaps for those who desire it, a guild could buy “help” from the Guild Initiative that would be somewhat like the heroes or henchmen of GW. These could be for just getting the Guild Hall and then be unavailable afterwards. It would be very helpful in letting smaller guilds feel included and able to enjoy getting their very own Guild Hall.</p>\n<p>Thanks anyways for all the fun. This is again just a suggestion. I have no other idea where to place this, so if this is the wrong forum to offer a suggestion, please let me know the best method to do so. Also, I look forward to all the many more fun and exciting updates that GW2 will continue to roll out.</p>\n<p>See you in game!</p>","arenanet":false}]}
