I’m thankful that you launched the API and got the attention back on the “extended experience”. What you started definitely showed that 3rd party tools are a great way to extend the game experience. So thank you for that! And I wish you all the best at your new job, and with your life!</p>\n<p>That being said, welcome Stefan! I hope you will be able to live up to the expectations that people have with the announcements of what’s coming for the API.

Like any software firm wanting to release quality products, ANet software has to be discussed, scheduled, go through “formal change control,” and be thoroughly tested (and even then, we know, not everything comes out as intended). In contrast, player-developed tools can be planned on a napkin, get tested when live, and the player devs can work whenever suits them.</p>\n<p>End result: we get all sorts of useful tools without having to compete with all of the other priorities at ANet. It greatly improves <em>my</em> in-game experience to have access to things like mos.millenium.com’s wvw maps, gw2stuff.com’s boss event timer, gw2state.com’s temple status, the wiki’s full set of details on events and items (recovered via the API), and various other sites.</p>","arenanet":false},{"pubDate":"2013-08-28T17:43:44.000Z","guid":"http://forum-en.guildwars2.com/forum/community/api/New-API-developer/2721353","author":"Stefan Larimore.6872","body":"\n<blockquote><div class=\"citey\"><cite title=\"Posted on August 27 2013 07:37PM\"><a href=\"/forum/community/api/New-API-developer/2714393\">Marcus Greythorne.6843:</a></cite></div><div class=\"quotey\"><p>Hi and welcome Stefan!

To answer your question:</p>\n<p>In my understanding, comes down to a question of resources and priorities.  Sometimes there is information in one part of the system that is expensive to expose in-game in a quality manner.  Or perhaps the information is not deemed necessary for typical play, so its priority is reduced.  However, it may be relatively simple to expose via an API.  This is where 3rd party apps can come in to fill the void.  We provide the APIs, and 3rd party apps provide the advanced experience.</p>","arenanet":true},{"pubDate":"2013-08-28T02:40:28.000Z","guid":"http://forum-en.guildwars2.com/forum/community/api/New-API-developer/2717079","author":"Killer Rhino.6794","body":"\n<p>Greetings Stefan!</p>\n<p>Can’t wait to see OAuth2 get rolled out; thank you for your ongoing work on it!

In fact, another programmer who’s been working with Cliff long before the transition will be shortly here to take over Cliff’s role on the API Development subforum. So be ensured that it may not be a big change, we in fact have more developers helping with the API behind the scene.</p>\n<p>Thanks everyone for your participation to this community.</p>\n<p><strong>EDIT: in fact Cliff wanted to share the following with the API community:</strong></p>\n<p>_Hi everyone,</p>\n<p>As Stephane said, I’m leaving ArenaNet, but I’ve had an incredible time here. I’ve wanted to work on public API since I started here, and I’m really happy that we’ve been able to start releasing them. I’ve been thrilled with the positive response to the APIs, and the community you’ve formed around creating apps. I’ll be eagerly watching to see how both the API and API apps develop in the future. Thanks for your support and enthusiasm while we’ve worked together._</p>","arenanet":true}]}
