The whole thing is way to restrictive. In game most of the information is accessible to most members (the only difference is that they are read-only / not modifiable) so it makes no sense at all that in the API it’s only restricted to guild leaders.</p>\n<p>Furthermore the endpoint should have a place to query guild functionnality access for a given appkey / accountname similar to what tokeninfo does. Currently it’s working on hit or miss (either the account has access or it does not) but we cannot tell that before hand without querying part of the endpoint and trying to figure out if the query failed or not.</p>","arenanet":false},{"pubDate":"2016-04-30T18:48:35.000Z","guid":"http://forum-en.guildwars2.com/forum/community/api/Authenticated-Idea-request/6130381","author":"Reincarnated.1754","body":"\n<p>At the moment only Guild Leaders (Owner / top Rank) can see Guild Authenticated  API endpoints.</p>\n<p>Some guilds I’m in (sure it would be the same for others) have members in the second to top rank that they would like to have access to the API results, and they don’t want to put them in the owners rank.
