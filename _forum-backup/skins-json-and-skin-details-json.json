The API bug was patched last hotfix.</p></div></blockquote>\n<p>Hi Lishtenbird,</p>\n<p>Yes, this isn’t the correct forum.  But I went ahead and inquired internally here to someone who might know.  In short, this can be considered a bug, but one that is not easy or fast to fix.  There is a desire to address this along with some other improvements to the tool tips of transmuted items.  But there is no ETA for this.</p>\n<p>As to any ETA for other API releases, unfortunately I don’t have one right now either.</p>\n<p>Thanks all!</p>","arenanet":true},{"pubDate":"2014-04-18T22:23:42.000Z","guid":"http://forum-en.guildwars2.com/forum/community/api/skins-json-and-skin-details-json/3924519","author":"darthmaim.6017","body":"\n<p>This is awesome, tomorrow i will see what <del>evil</del> fun stuff i can do with it :P</p>","arenanet":false},{"pubDate":"2014-04-18T20:55:00.000Z","guid":"http://forum-en.guildwars2.com/forum/community/api/skins-json-and-skin-details-json/3924136","author":"LadyRhonwyn.2501","body":"\n<blockquote><div class=\"citey\"><cite title=\"Posted on April 18 2014 08:22PM\"><a href=\"/forum/community/api/skins-json-and-skin-details-json/3923962\">Dr Ishmael.9685:</a></cite></div><div class=\"quotey\"><p>Skin/wardrobe prefix is 0×0B (11).</p></div></blockquote>\n<p>thanks, now I’ll know what I’ll have to implement tomorrow :P</p>","arenanet":false},{"pubDate":"2014-04-18T20:22:48.000Z","guid":"http://forum-en.guildwars2.com/forum/community/api/skins-json-and-skin-details-json/3923962","author":"Dr Ishmael.9685","body":"\n<p>Skin/wardrobe prefix is 0×0B (11).</p>","arenanet":false},{"pubDate":"2014-04-18T20:19:53.000Z","guid":"http://forum-en.guildwars2.com/forum/community/api/skins-json-and-skin-details-json/3923943","author":"LadyRhonwyn.2501","body":"\n<p>Hm, how do those skin id’s translate to a chat code?
