All types of discovery are persistent; discovery doesn’t reset after a build. During a new patch, some of the APIs can temporarily show fewer results than normal while the new servers come online, but this should quickly resolve itself.</p>\n<blockquote><div class=\"citey\"><cite title=\"Posted on May 28 2013 08:37PM\"><a href=\"/forum/community/api/world-names-json-is-broken/2108432\">rodadams.5963:</a></cite></div><div class=\"quotey\"><p>I have a script which dumps all the items and recipes to a local store.
