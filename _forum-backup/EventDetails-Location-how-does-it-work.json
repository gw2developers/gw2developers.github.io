I have been able to map PointOfInterest.Coord very well to the tile API, but I am still unable to see any relationship between the data in EventDetails.Location and the tile API. At this point I am unsure if this location can really be used to locate an event in the map and how. Does anyone now?</p>\n<p>Here is an example:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://api.guildwars2.com/v1/event_details.json?lang=en&event_id=C4A63BCF-B6F9-45E8-87AD-0C94706B1202\">https://api.guildwars2.com/v1/event_details.json?lang=en&amp;event_id=C4A63BCF-B6F9-45E8-87AD-0C94706B1202</a></p>\n<p>{\"events\":{\"C4A63BCF-B6F9-45E8-87AD-0C94706B1202\":{\"name\":“Defend Barthol on his way to the Old Armory.”,<a href=\"6\">level</a>,<a href=\"15\">map_id</a>,“flags”:[],“location”:{\"type\":“cylinder”,<a href=\"[-7512\">center</a>,<br>\n11993,<br>\n-1120],<a href=\"696\">height</a>,<a href=\"2000\">radius</a>,<a href=\"0}}}}\">rotation</a></p>\n<p>As you can see, location contains a type, which seems to be a geometry, and a center, which is apparently an X,Y,Z value, but I am unsure how I can use this center to locate the initial position of the event on the map.</p>\n<p>Any ideas?</p>","arenanet":false}]}
