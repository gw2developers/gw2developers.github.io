Most of the images are returning as 64×64, which is fine for many devices.  But on retina, it would be nice to have 128×128 for a 64×64 container size.  If you’re using a standard image server, that option should be available to add to the API.  The query URL could include the size, as in:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://render.guildwars2.com/file/{signature}/{file_id}.{format}?size={size}\">https://render.guildwars2.com/file/{signature}/{file_id}.{format}?size={size}</a><br>\nor<br>\n<a href=\"https://render.guildwars2.com/file/{signature}/{size}/{file_id}.{format}\">https://render.guildwars2.com/file/{signature}/{size}/{file_id}.{format}</a></p>\n<p>The {size} should probably be enumerated, like [small | medium | large] where small = 64×64, medium = 128×128, and large = 256 × 256.  I can imagine large would be useful if the underlying artwork for the asset would support that resolution.</p>\n<p>BTW, this item’s icon comes back as 128×128.  Not sure where the problem is there, but indicates that larger renditions should be available for the artwork.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://render.guildwars2.com/file/CACFF93ECF1B0F242EC32FAF5EC17108BDC6B900/220501.png\">https://render.guildwars2.com/file/CACFF93ECF1B0F242EC32FAF5EC17108BDC6B900/220501.png</a></p>","arenanet":false}]}
