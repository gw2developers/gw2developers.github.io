The problem is in the prize pool. I want to gather a significant prize pool, preferably at least 1000$. Given the size of the GW2 playerbase, that’s a small amount. However I want to do this in a way that’s, for lack of a better word, unscammable. I’m fine with using my own paypal as the in between account, but most other people probably aren’t and I understand that.</p>\n<p>So, suggestions needed on how to do this properly. Is there a good and honest way for such things already available?</p>","arenanet":false}]}
