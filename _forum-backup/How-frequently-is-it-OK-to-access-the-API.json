An issue will will come up against is that getting the entire item array and then iterating through it to get each item is a loooong operation and a ton of objects (especially if you are doing this for a mobile app). Consider there are nearly 30k ids and you could be doing an individual connection for every item.</p>\n<p>A practical solution I came up with is to create an SQL database and write a PHPscript to populate it. Each entry in my case contains the item ID, name, type, rarity and level.</p>\n<p>In the UI the user selects a type filter and level/rarity if they desire, then the app queries the database for all matching, puts their names into a dynamic list and holds on to only the item_id. When one is picked is connects to the API to get the rest of the details and displays them all pretty like.</p>\n<p>You’ll be keeping API calls minimal and low resource usage on the user side.</p>\n<p>You can also schedule the script to run once a week or so to query the GW2 build number, and update the database if its changed (which in all liklihood will be every kitten time with all the updates) but its still better than your app making 30k api calls on each use.</p>","arenanet":false},{"pubDate":"2013-09-11T00:47:17.000Z","guid":"http://forum-en.guildwars2.com/forum/community/api/How-frequently-is-it-OK-to-access-the-API/2815206","author":"smiley.1438","body":"\n<p>Cliff answered this more than once before and stated that there’s no specific limit but it would be good when we’d cache the results when possible.</p>\n<p>See: <a href=\"https://forum-en.guildwars2.com/forum/community/api/How-often-is-the-event-data-updated/first#post2063497\">https://forum-en.guildwars2.com/forum/community/api/How-often-is-the-event-data-updated/first#post2063497</a><br>\nand<br>\n<a href=\"https://forum-en.guildwars2.com/forum/community/api/names-json-static/first#post2064473\">https://forum-en.guildwars2.com/forum/community/api/names-json-static/first#post2064473</a></p>","arenanet":false},{"pubDate":"2013-09-10T23:18:28.000Z","guid":"http://forum-en.guildwars2.com/forum/community/api/How-frequently-is-it-OK-to-access-the-API/2814806","author":"Eethy.6421","body":"\n<p>I’m working on a sort of item database app.</p>\n<p>My notion is to get the item IDs from <a href=\"https://api.guildwars2.com/v1/items.json\">https://api.guildwars2.com/v1/items.json</a> and then request each item individually to refresh my data.</p>\n<p>I’m trying to cache all the item data in order to implement some searching and sorting.</p>\n<p>Is that alright?</p>\n<p>Do that, say, every five minutes would that be ok?</p>\n<p>Thanks<img src=\"/include/images/smilies/smile.png\"></p>","arenanet":false}]}
