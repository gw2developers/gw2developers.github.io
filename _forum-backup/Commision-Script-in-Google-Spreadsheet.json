A friend of mine helped me code a few things in my spreadsheet (I know nothing about coding), but due to the lack of time, he has not been able to finish it so I’m looking for someone to help me out. Most of it should be done already.</p>\n<p>The coding will be in a google spreadsheet and will be using the GW2 Spidy API (or something similar) to import prices and other data into the spreadsheet. Experience with both would be preferable. The script I need is pretty much just to import prices (from the graphs on the website) and do a few calculations before giving me the raw numbers. I guess we can just meet up on TS and I’ll explain exactly what he was trying to code and what I want the script to do.</p>\n<p>I am going to compensate the person in gold, how much will depend on the amount of work required to finish the script (50g as a minimum). Please let me know if this is somehow against the TOS, I just see the art commissions all the time, and assumed this kind of thing would be fine (otherwise we can call it a “gift”).</p>\n<p>Hers is a link to the research is anyone is interested: <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1fVpco8hEdap2AtcB3NCbMovHtrPu-mbrYSLqwbue4fg/edit#gid=1079668078\">https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1fVpco8hEdap2AtcB3NCbMovHtrPu-mbrYSLqwbue4fg/edit#gid=1079668078</a></p>","arenanet":false}]}
