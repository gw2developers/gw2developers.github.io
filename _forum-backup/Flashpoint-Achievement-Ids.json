I now understand this issue.

There’s an <a href=\"https://github.com/arenanet/api-cdi/issues/523\">open issue for this</a> but I’m not sure when I’ll  have time to implement it.</p>\n<p>Using the ?ids parameter basically just returns a subset of all the account’s achievements — it won’t return anything that isn’t available when no parameters are provided. If the achievement ids don’t show up via just /v2/account/achievements, the API doesn’t think you have them.</p>\n<p>Given the Flashpoint achievements are all permanent, it’s not clear to me why the API wouldn’t return them (unless you have no progress towards them?). Could you PM me the API key you’re using?

I came across an error that’s puzzling me. Whenever I make an API for all the achievements in the flashpoint category, I’m getting “text”: “all ids provided are invalid”.</p>\n<p>This also happens in the daily category.</p>\n<p>This is my call for the Flashpoint category: <a href=\"https://api.guildwars2.com/v2/account/achievements?ids=3442,3418,3404,3431,3435,3401,3446,3396,3422,3412,3395,3428,3398,3437,3410,3407,3421,3424,3423,3427,3439,3405,3420,3403,3408,3430,3400,3402,3445,3447,3436,3429,3406,3433,3441,3434,3440&access_token\">https://api.guildwars2.com/v2/account/achievements?ids=3442,3418,3404,3431,3435,3401,3446,3396,3422,3412,3395,3428,3398,3437,3410,3407,3421,3424,3423,3427,3439,3405,3420,3403,3408,3430,3400,3402,3445,3447,3436,3429,3406,3433,3441,3434,3440&amp;access_token</a>=[redacted api-key]</p>\n<p>Can seem to find anything about this in the forums currently. Hoping for a bit of insight. I have a hunch that it’s because I haven’t logged in yet, and maybe my account doesn’t have a status for these achievements, so there’s no reference? Is that a thing? It sounds far-fetched, but it’s all I can think of.</p>","arenanet":false}]}
