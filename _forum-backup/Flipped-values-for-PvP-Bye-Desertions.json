When I’ve worked with the API a few weeks ago to get the pvp-stats-tool working, I’ve googled around to get the right explanations for the terms. So that is, what I’ve got/found and seems to be right (in context of the API):</p>\n<p>Bye = You won, one or more enemies left the team before the match ended<br>\nForfeit = You loose, one or more of your teammates left the team before the match ended<br>\nDesertion = You left the game before the match ended.</p>\n<p>As I’ve seen in some matches, if you get a disconnect (or more disconnects) and come back a whole time later (1 – 2 minutes or so) it counts as Desertion, even If you were on the map at the end of the match.</p>\n<p>For the whole matches I’ve played since tracking my data, I got no Desertion (I didn’t leave matches :-) expect on dc) and the other match-details (and aggregated numbers) seems correct to me.

After checking the matches of these players, the game of Novuake.2691 got marked as “Desertion” (but he won), the game of uhohhotdog.3598 got marked as “Bye” (but he lost). Now, according to the info <a href=\"https://forum-en.guildwars2.com/forum/community/api/New-endpoints-pvp-and-char-specializations/first#post5452470\">here</a> they mean the following:</p>\n<blockquote><div class=\"quotey\"><p>“Bye” is when somebody on opposing team disconnects and you win. “Desertion” is when somebody on your team disconnects and you lose.</p></div></blockquote>\n<p>So. Either the API returns them flipped for some reason, or that information is wrong. Any insights? <img src=\"/include/images/smilies/deecolon.png\"></p>","arenanet":false}]}
