It helps that it is used in used on gw2stats.net, so you can browse there to see rather than take my word for it lol. Gw2stats.net is a very smoothly functioning site, so that leads me to believe that the library behind it is pretty solid.</p>\n<p>Cons-ish:<br>\nThe only downside is that the source pretty complicated, at least as a beginner/intermediateish C# dev, I find the source it a bit on the complicated side. Then again, I was trying to understand the source from top top bottom as opposed  to just using library. As far as just using the library goes, there is documentation on the documentation tab and it isn’t that hard to wrap your mind around.
