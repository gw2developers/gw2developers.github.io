It has a default password ‘changeit’ but the user might have altered this.<br>\nSo one possibility would be to create an empty KeyStore instance, and just load in that single certificate you want to use. Then establish a SSL connection just this KeyStore instance instead of the default one. Of course, if you then want to use this SSL connection object, whichever it might be, for another SSL connection to a different server, you will have to set the default keystore again…</p>\n<p>Here is an example how to add a key during runtime to the default KeyStore.

You would either have to include the certificate, or download it during runtime (which would on the otherhand completely bypass the security aspect of SSL).<br>\nThe first idea on the otherhand adds another layer of maintenance needed, as the certificates might change in the future (shouldn’t be a common issue, but might happen). In that case you would have to make a new version.<br>\nBesides it requires alot more work on the clientside to set everything up.</p>\n<p>And what exactly do we accomplish? We secure the transfer of data like, event ids, item descriptions etc.<br>\nIt’s not like we are transmitting personalised data or something.<br>\nI could understand if we get personal data, like character informations etc.<br>\nThose would atleast make a bit of sense to submit via SSL.</p>\n<p>But in that case we would probably also need tokens for different aspects (like Eve have multiple API tokens).<br>\nThe user then has a keytoken for the public API, which will be used for public informations like the current event, wvw, item and recipe informations, and whatever else comes.<br>\nThen they also have a private keytoken, which allows them to fetch character informations etc.<br>\nPerhaps they could add a third type, which would be kinda like a limited private keytoken, which just includes certain private data, for example account and character names and classes. These could be useful for LFG sites for example, to add a list of characters available if someones is looking for a group etc.<br>\nThe private keytoken on the other hand could also include equipment and bank informations for example (this might have an application in case a guild wants to have a member overview etc…).</p>\n<p>But the current API we have is secure for no reason I can see.<br>\nEven if you are going to communicate with the wrong server in case of HTTP, what is the worse that can happen?

It’s just that you will have a hard time giving away your program, when it requires either a 3rd party program on top of that, a manual installation by the user (with the 3rd party program or per commandline), or an automated script to do this for you (which might aswell fail, in case someone is using a different password than the standard one).<br>\nJava is meant to be easy to setup, while giving the user a somewhat save environment.
