When that rule was given, there was a hard limit of 10 items at a time, so multiple simultaneous calls were necessary to pull in everything in a timely manner.  Since most of these new API calls let you pull in all of the data at once (and doesn’t take an hour to do so), I’d say just don’t overlap.  Last run of the events.json without parameters took me 6.5 seconds, so I would probably just run it every 7 seconds.  Any faster would be presuming that your information is out of date before you even get it, which is a problem that can’t be solved by more runs anyways.</p>\n<p>So if nothing else, wait for your previous call on that output to finish.</p>","arenanet":false},{"pubDate":"2013-05-22T14:36:41.000Z","guid":"http://forum-en.guildwars2.com/forum/community/api/How-Often-I-can-Access-the-api/2073485","author":"Gilosean.3805","body":"\n<blockquote><div class=\"citey\"><cite title=\"Posted on May 22 2013 02:14PM\"><a href=\"/forum/community/api/How-Often-I-can-Access-the-api/2073363\">marnick.4305:</a></cite></div><div class=\"quotey\"><blockquote><div class=\"citey\"><cite title=\"Posted on May 22 2013 01:33PM\"><a href=\"/forum/community/api/How-Often-I-can-Access-the-api/2073144\">Gilosean.3805:</a></cite></div><div class=\"quotey\"><blockquote><div class=\"citey\"><cite title=\"Posted on May 22 2013 01:20PM\"><a href=\"/forum/community/api/How-Often-I-can-Access-the-api/2073076\">marnick.4305:</a></cite></div><div class=\"quotey\"><p>In PVE, having an API call every second is more than plenty for almost all purposes.

The thing is that if we are relying on accurate timers and not hanging around the area, events probably won’t go into overflow before the event starts.  So it could still make a difference.</p>\n<p>I’d still say that for events that so many people are interested in, pinging more frequently is a good idea. Maybe not down to ms, but once every second.  No need to do that for regular events though.  Just have a the single-event queries for the metaevents with chests and get a general event dump every minute, something like that.</p>","arenanet":false},{"pubDate":"2013-05-22T14:14:27.000Z","guid":"http://forum-en.guildwars2.com/forum/community/api/How-Often-I-can-Access-the-api/2073363","author":"marnick.4305","body":"\n<blockquote><div class=\"citey\"><cite title=\"Posted on May 22 2013 01:33PM\"><a href=\"/forum/community/api/How-Often-I-can-Access-the-api/2073144\">Gilosean.3805:</a></cite></div><div class=\"quotey\"><blockquote><div class=\"citey\"><cite title=\"Posted on May 22 2013 01:20PM\"><a href=\"/forum/community/api/How-Often-I-can-Access-the-api/2073076\">marnick.4305:</a></cite></div><div class=\"quotey\"><p>In PVE, having an API call every second is more than plenty for almost all purposes.
