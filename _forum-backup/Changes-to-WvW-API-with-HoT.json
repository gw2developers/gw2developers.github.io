Specifically will we be able to see all the information that clicking on an objective will do in game like what tier the objective is at and how long until the next one is reached.</p>\n<p>Also, if these changes are coming will they be out before HoT launch? It would be nice for new and existing sites to be able to update their sites for the new borderlands before it is out.</p>","arenanet":false}]}
