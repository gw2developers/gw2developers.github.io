Events in the ‘preparation’ state retain their previous state from the API’s perspective until the state changes again.</p>\n<p>Not all events have preparation states at all, and it’s often short for those that do, so this should not effect most events. However, events that are part of complex event chains may show incomplete or inaccurate information as a result of this bug.</p>\n<p>The bug will be fixed when the next game patch goes live, so if you’re having trouble with some events I’d recommend re-examining them at that time. Without deeply examining individual events, I can’t say whether this will fix any particular issue you may be having. If at that time there’s still a problem, please report it.</p>\n<p>I’ll also update this thread when the bug is fixed.</p></div></blockquote>","arenanet":false},{"pubDate":"2013-05-21T17:08:13.000Z","guid":"http://forum-en.guildwars2.com/forum/community/api/API-Bugged/2068443","author":"crouze.3078","body":"\n<p>Hi,</p>\n<p>We just did the Shadow Behemoth on our server and in the event list it still says “warmup”.
