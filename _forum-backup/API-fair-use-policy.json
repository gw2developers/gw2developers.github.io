However, I am in a personal dilemma right now because my application is requesting the API about 125 times per half an hour to gather all necessary information. I already made some frequency adjustments but still don’t know what amount of requests is okay. I found the “Website Terms of Use” and “Content Terms of Use” but nothing regarding a fair use policy. Does something like this exists?</p>\n<p>Kind regards<br>\nBroOf</p>","arenanet":false}]}
