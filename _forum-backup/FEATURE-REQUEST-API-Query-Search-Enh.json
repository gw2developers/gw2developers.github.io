If it was a problem, I should be filing a bug report instead of making a suggestion for a new API extension.</p>\n<blockquote><div class=\"citey\"><cite title=\"Posted on January 13 2015 10:10AM\"><a href=\"/forum/community/api/FEATURE-REQUEST-API-Query-Search-Enh/4688983\">Strategist.6132:</a></cite></div><div class=\"quotey\"><p>I mean right now you can easily mimic what that API is supposed to do.

That’s one of the reasons I’m making the suggestion.</p>\n<blockquote><div class=\"citey\"><cite title=\"Posted on January 13 2015 10:10AM\"><a href=\"/forum/community/api/FEATURE-REQUEST-API-Query-Search-Enh/4688983\">Strategist.6132:</a></cite></div><div class=\"quotey\"><p>I guess this also relieves some stress of the GW2 API servers.</p></div></blockquote>\n<p>It can, depending on whether they’re also utilizing their own API servers in-game. The bandwidth savings could be quite substantial all for having a dedicated search function that handles specific, repeatedly-used requests. That’s something for them to determine in-house to see if there is a benefit for rather than for us to speculate on, however. This function can, in theory, also be extended to or borrowed from the Black Lion Trading Post.</p>\n<blockquote><div class=\"citey\"><cite title=\"Posted on January 13 2015 10:10AM\"><a href=\"/forum/community/api/FEATURE-REQUEST-API-Query-Search-Enh/4688983\">Strategist.6132:</a></cite></div><div class=\"quotey\"><p>Even though I don’t think the idea’s you provided would be that heavy to implement/run.</p></div></blockquote>\n<p>No, performing the initial query may not be so bad, but performing subsequent recursive queries only to throw away the data is, especially if your application updates that single dataset frequently. It’s wasteful of both a site’s and ArenaNet’s bandwidth if they don’t want all of the data.</p>\n<blockquote><div class=\"citey\"><cite title=\"Posted on January 13 2015 10:10AM\"><a href=\"/forum/community/api/FEATURE-REQUEST-API-Query-Search-Enh/4688983\">Strategist.6132:</a></cite></div><div class=\"quotey\"><p>But for example a /v2/recipies?name= operation, where you search for recipes with a word in the title of the recipe, would quickly get spammed by autocomplete functions of developers and wouldn’t be a good idea.</p></div></blockquote>\n<p>Because someone can’t implement that now if they were so inclined? If there is a concern about constant queries from external, non ArenaNet sources, my guess is they’re addressing it. And if not, they might be soon. Who knows for sure?</p>\n<blockquote><div class=\"citey\"><cite title=\"Posted on January 13 2015 10:10AM\"><a href=\"/forum/community/api/FEATURE-REQUEST-API-Query-Search-Enh/4688983\">Strategist.6132:</a></cite></div><div class=\"quotey\"><p>The idea is nice!

I expect that if Pat Cavit and his team take this on, this will be a slow burning project released over the next year or two, if that. I have no idea how many developers they have and with Heart of Thorns coming out in a few months, plus other balance and bug fixes, they have their hands pretty full. This is definitely a “would be nice to have” and I’m not holding my breath waiting for it.</p>\n<p>Thank you!</p>","arenanet":false},{"pubDate":"2015-04-21T04:12:24.000Z","guid":"http://forum-en.guildwars2.com/forum/community/api/FEATURE-REQUEST-API-Query-Search-Enh/4989541","author":"alkaniserval.5963","body":"\n<blockquote><div class=\"citey\"><cite title=\"Posted on January 13 2015 05:49PM\"><a href=\"/forum/community/api/FEATURE-REQUEST-API-Query-Search-Enh/4690171\">Pat Cavit.9234:</a></cite></div><div class=\"quotey\"><p>We’re going to do some experiments around searching to see if we can’t start offering richer search APIs in the future.

My hope is that simplified searches will help reduce the overall number of queries, application processing, and network traffic required for someone to get a set piece of information. I know you all have a lot on your plate and there may not be adequate demand for these, but seeing as some of the in-game browsing also uses, or at least seems to use based on the APIs, HTTPS for communications (and likely processes the information gathered from these same JSON queries) this might be helpful in the long run as a slow-burner project.</p>\n<p>If there’s anything I can do to assist, please feel free to reach out to me either in-game or via message here.</p>\n<p>Thank you!</p>","arenanet":false},{"pubDate":"2015-01-13T17:49:36.000Z","guid":"http://forum-en.guildwars2.com/forum/community/api/FEATURE-REQUEST-API-Query-Search-Enh/4690171","author":"Pat Cavit.9234","body":"\n<p>We’re going to do some experiments around searching to see if we can’t start offering richer search APIs in the future.
