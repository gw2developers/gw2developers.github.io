I saw Cliff description on item_details.json:</p>\n<ul>\n\t<li>infusion slots now show the item_id of the infusion instead of the full item details.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>But I only see the infusion slots being returned as:</p>\n<p>“infusion_slots”:[{\"flags\":[“Defense”]}]</p>\n<p>It used to be:<br>\n</p><pre><code>\n\tinfusion_slots = [list]\n\t\titem = str\n\t\t\t(no content)\n\t\tflags = [list]\n\t\t\tDefense\n\t\t\tOffense\n\t\t\tUtility\n</code></pre>The only difference is that they removed the item string which was always empty, so I don’t understand how that relates to Cliff’s comment.  For example,<p></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://api.guildwars2.com/v1/item_details.json?item_id=39550\">https://api.guildwars2.com/v1/item_details.json?item_id=39550</a></p>\n<p>2.  Does the new “flags” property in recipe_details.json need to be an array?  Every recipe so far are either AutoLearned or LearnedFromItem, never both.  Perhaps there would be other flags values added later that would require “flags” to be an array?</p>\n<p>Thanks.</p>","arenanet":false}]}
