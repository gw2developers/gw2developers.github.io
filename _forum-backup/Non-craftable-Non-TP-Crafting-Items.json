Only just starting using these forums and the search function doesn’t seem to be working for me. Anyway. Does there exist a machine readable list of these types of items anywhere, along with prices or acquisition information (for items that cannot be bought from crafting vendors / karma merchants). I’m creating a section of my app that calculates crafting cost for all items, and this is obviously necessary information. I know the bigger gw2 sites must have solved this, but I don’t see anyone offering the info in like a json or csv file, which would be ideal. If not I’d be glad to start compiling one in google spreadsheets for others who are interested.</p>","arenanet":false}]}
