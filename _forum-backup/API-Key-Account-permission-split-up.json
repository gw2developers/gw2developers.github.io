I don’t see how those are required to access account information, I think they should be allowed/disallowed separately from the account GUID.  For example, why would a third-party app need to know my display name — ever?  Is it so the author of the app can search my forums postings?</p>\n<p>Request/Suggestion: Could the API Key permissions be partitioned a little so that the GUID is the only “required” permission (i.e., “account” permission == GUID) and the remainder of the “account” permissions are broken out into their own group?</p>","arenanet":false}]}
