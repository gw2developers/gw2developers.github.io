Is the cost of 127 skill points worth a 37g profit?  Maybe or maybe not.  It depends on the player, but I think with time, many characters are going to accumulate lots of skill points as they level up even at level 80.  So what are they going to do with all those skill points?  In the end, we would still leave it to the users to decide for themselves if it is worth it or not.</p>","arenanet":false},{"pubDate":"2013-06-10T18:15:25.000Z","guid":"http://forum-en.guildwars2.com/forum/community/api/Mystic-Forge-Recipes/2188058","author":"Yamagawa.5941","body":"\n<p>I agree with your statements:</p>\n<ul>\n\t<li>as far as the app is concerned, it just outputs whatever karma or skill points cost it would take.</li>\n\t<li>the user decides their worth.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>There is fine print that I find I’ll have to remain vague on, and any disagreement we might have will come from that fine print.
