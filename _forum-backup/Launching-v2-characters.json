I don’t play Dungeons myself, but I have heard a few people complain about players being aggressive on gear or professions you run. (Of course I don’t agree with this behaviour) Even though this can happen, I personally think it’s better that you get told upfront that they rather want another profession or other gear (you don’t want to stick which such a group anyway:P) then that they are raging about it during or after the dungeon path. Aside that, there would be no need to ask for the key, since the player could already easily link his/her armor them in the chat. (I think most players wouldn’t know about the keys)</p>\n<p>But as you already noticed, I was aiming more for sPvP. It would be nice if you could check the builds enemies characters run while you’re waiting before the match, so you can discuss strategy a bit more. Or to see how successful people have been with certain builds for the past matches. I think cool things could be realized this way.</p>\n<p>Maybe it is an option to split the sPvP build and the PvE build such that we don’t have the dungeon problems? But I guess this will be a bit of a hassle to maintain. So I still voting for builds to be publicly available without key. Of course I do believe that the online stat shouldn’t be shown to everyone.</p>\n<p>Maybe it is a good idea to provide an authorized friendlist API where players can see who is online? I am not sure if it is possible to also chat with friend using the API? That would be really amazing, but it might be tough to implement.</p>\n<p>Thanks for sharing your view!</p>\n<p>EDIT: I just looked up the Damage Meter, and I really agree that would be a bad idea. I hope the community will take care of the armor checks though. Overall if most people think the same way about just enjoying the game with people then it should be alright I hope.</p>","arenanet":false},{"pubDate":"2015-06-21T12:44:10.000Z","guid":"http://forum-en.guildwars2.com/forum/community/api/Launching-v2-characters/5183239","author":"Killerassel.2197","body":"\n<p>The build itself (i.e. selection of traits), especially after the upcoming patch, would probably not be that problematic.

This endpoint provides the non-inventory-related bits detailed in <a href=\"https://github.com/arenanet/api-cdi/pull/16\">this pull request</a>, and requires an API key with “characters” permission from the person whose data you want to access.</p>\n<p>Some examples — it basically works in the same manner as most of the other endpoints. The base URL returns a list of all the account’s character names:</p>\n<pre><code>    GET /v2/characters HTTP/1.1\n    Authorization: Bearer &lt;api-key&gt;\n\n    HTTP/1.1 200 OK\n    Content-Type: application/json\n\n    [ \"Logan Thackeray\", \"Eir Stegalkin\"]\n \n</code></pre>\n<p>You can retrieve individual character blobs by putting them in the next URL component (or in a comma-delimited <code>ids</code> query parameter). Also note that you can pass the API key via the <code>access_token</code> query parameter if you’re making CORS requests (rather than setting the <code>Authorization</code> header):</p>\n<pre><code>    GET /v2/characters/Logan%20Thackeray?access_token=&lt;api-key&gt;\n\n    HTTP/1.1 200 OK\n    Content-Type: application/json\n\n    {\n        \"name\": \"Logan Thackeray\",\n        \"race\": \"Charr\",\n        \"gender\": \"Male\",\n        \"profession\": \"Guardian\",\n        \"level\": 80,\n        \"guild\": \"4BBB52AA-D768-4FC6-8EDE-C299F2822F0F\"\n    }\n \n</code></pre>\n<p>Alternatively, you can make paginated requests. Metadata about the pagination details (e.g., the number of pages/results that can be requested) is returned in the response headers for ease-of-use.</p>\n<pre><code>    GET /v2/characters?page=0&amp;page_size=50 HTTP/1.1\n    Authorization: Bearer &lt;api-key&gt;\n\n    HTTP/1.1 200 OK\n    Content-Type: application/json\n    Link: &lt;/v2/characters?page=0&amp;page_size=50&gt;; rel=self, &lt;/v2/characters?page=0&amp;page_size=50&gt;; rel=first, &lt;/v2/characters?page=0&amp;page_size=50&gt;; rel=last\n    X-Page-Size: 50\n    X-Page-Total: 1\n    X-Result-Count: 2\n    X-Result-Total: 2\n\n    [\n        {\n            \"name\": \"Logan Thackeray\",\n            \"race\": \"Charr\",\n            \"gender\": \"Male\",\n            \"profession\": \"Guardian\",\n            \"level\": 80,\n            \"guild\": \"4BBB52AA-D768-4FC6-8EDE-C299F2822F0F\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"name\": \"Eir Stegalkin\",\n            \"race\": \"Sylvari\",\n            \"gender\": \"Female\",\n            \"profession\": \"Thief\",\n            \"level\": 80\n        }\n    ]\n \n</code></pre>\n<p>Right now the information returned is fairly basic, but we’ll be adding in the ability to pull character inventories, equipment, traits and skills later on.</p>\n<p>Due to technical constraints (wibbly wobbly distributed systems) the character blobs may be a bit stale (up to 5 minutes, I think), so factor that in if you’re making a guild rep tracking system or something (because I know someone’s going to do that).</p>\n<p>Let me know if you’ve got any questions/concerns and I’ll do my best to answer ’em.</p>","arenanet":true}]}
