That being said I have to sincerely ask who’s idea was it to make black lion chest completely worthless. Lets say I could live with the drop rate which is not as good as it used to be of ticket scraps. The forced item taking you from 3 slots 2 is unfair and unreasonable and there is not even an option to turn it off. the new chest system is a really big slap in the face even if your not a person that spends your money to get keys because the grind for completing maps for keys instead of paying for them make devaluing chest even more offensive. It’s not right. It’s really not.</p>","arenanet":false}]}
