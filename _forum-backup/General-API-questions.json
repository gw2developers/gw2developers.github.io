I am stuck between writing a wrapper in C# for the API or writing an actual dashboard type program for GW2. I was wondering if there are any limits on the amount of requests we can/should send in a certain period of time? Second, is there a tool/resource where I can see the list of used item ID’s or at least what numbers they range from? Third would anyone actually be interested in a C# wrapper for V2 of the API?</p>\n<p>Thanks!</p>","arenanet":false}]}
