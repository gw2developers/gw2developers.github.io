So I cannot make a guild-roster (I know we are getting a function to get the guild-roster) where (for example) we then show the characters or the guild-members and their gear.</p>\n<p>Guild-members could have the ability to (in advanced security options) allow guilds / guild-leaders to see some information like the armor their character have on. (some information could be on by default and some could be off by default). Than have the ability to put a password on a guild and allow for authentication using that password (So you don’t authenticate as a player but as a guild). The guild could also have its own authentication roles (what information should be available).</p>\n<p>In that way you have a secure way to show all the type of information guilds might want to show on their site. Guild-roster, including specs of the guild-members (if members do not disable that ability), message of the day, items in the guild-bank, completed guild-missions, combined gold of all members (if members would share their amount of gold with the guild). Everything is possible, but everything can also been closed off for privacy / security reasons.</p>\n<p>One of the main features would be the guild-roster with detailed character information of all guild-members. That is why I mention it in this thread.</p>","arenanet":false},{"pubDate":"2015-06-30T05:57:45.000Z","guid":"http://forum-en.guildwars2.com/forum/community/api/Launching-inventory-endpoints/5231585","author":"Loex.5104","body":"\n<blockquote><div class=\"citey\"><cite title=\"Posted on June 25 2015 08:55PM\"><a href=\"/forum/community/api/Launching-inventory-endpoints/5211613\">Lawton Campbell.8517:</a></cite></div><div class=\"quotey\"><p>Activated a handful of new endpoints — mostly authenticated and require the “inventories” permission — that provide access to an account’s various inventories:</p>\n<ul>\n\t<li><a href=\"https://api.guildwars2.com/v2/materials?ids=all\">/v2/materials</a> - unauthenticated endpoint which provides localized names and contents for each of the material storage tabs.
