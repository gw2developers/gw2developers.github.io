The endpoint <a href=\"https://api.guildwars2.com/v2/commerce/listings/\">https://api.guildwars2.com/v2/commerce/listings/</a> returns, without specifying an id, a list of all ids. My question is now:</p>\n<p>Does the list of ids indicate, that every of these listed items are items that COULD be in the trading post or does the list of ids indicate, that there is a listing for every of this ids?</p>\n<p>Because my english isnt the best and i want u to understand my question, im going a bit deeper..</p>\n<p>There are some items in the tradingpost with the same name, e.g. “Pistol” (about 10 different ones). Like three of them are not listed in the trading post (because there are no buyers and sellers for this item), but all three COULD be listed, because they are sellable. So im wondering, if the list tells me, that all ids returned, are items which at least have one listing (buy or sell) or are generally sellable in the tradingspost.</p>\n<p>I hope u all understand my question.</p>\n<p>Thank u in advance</p>","arenanet":false}]}
