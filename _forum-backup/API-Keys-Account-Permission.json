Why is the “account” permission mandatory?</p>\n<p>It seems to me that the most popular applications for the API keys is to calculate the gold value of the bank/material storage/inventory. To work properly, these applications need the “inventories” and  “wallet” permissions, but wouldn’t strictly need the “account” data.</p>\n<p>I see the <em>theoretical</em> possibility that such a “net account value” application could use the API data to select profitable targets for hacking attempts. If the account permission wasn’t necessary, the applications could still work properly to calculate the account value, but don’t know <em>which</em> account is worth so much.</p>\n<p>Is there a technical reason why the “account” permission is mandatory? Or am I the only one who is paranoid enough to think of this scenario?</p>","arenanet":false}]}
