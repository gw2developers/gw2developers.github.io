I’ve implemented for our guild a website, which has a lot of organisation tools. Atm, we have to do all tasks twice. For example we have to kick someone at the website and afterwards in the game or vice versa. It would be cool to get access to the game, to our guild, via our website.<img src=\"/include/images/smilies/smile.png\"></p>\n<p>This should be very save, for example via access tokens or something like that.<img src=\"/include/images/smilies/colondee.png\"></p>","arenanet":false},{"pubDate":"2013-05-20T23:44:59.000Z","guid":"http://forum-en.guildwars2.com/forum/community/api/Will-there-be-API-for-Guilds/2064314","author":"XicerJD.3815","body":"\n<p>First of all, thaaank youuuu!</p>\n<p>The release of an official API is really awesome news!
