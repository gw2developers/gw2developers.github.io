This could help guild leaders plan events and mission times as well as give more information about the activity of the guild from outside the game.</p>\n<p>Having recently dived into the large amount of data available through the APIs, I really appreciate the hard work that’s gone into its organization and structure; what a great resource!</p>","arenanet":false}]}
