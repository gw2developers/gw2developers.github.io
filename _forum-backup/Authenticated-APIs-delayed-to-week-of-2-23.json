This is due to a variety of not-seen-in-development configuration issues we’re slowly working our way through.</p>\n<p>Once the APIs are available we’ll have a post announcing it and providing very basic getting started documentation. More complete docs should be on the wiki soon thereafter.</p>\n<p>Sorry for the delay everybody, and thanks for bearing with us while work through this.</p>","arenanet":true}]}
