But in that case, I also don’t ‘handle’ the exceptions, as there might be all sorts of Exceptions, starting from IOExceptions because the file wasn’t found over security exception because the user doesn’t have read rights to the certificate to CertificateExceptions because the stuff read in wasn’t an actual or incomplete certificate.</p>\n<p>Is there room for improvement? Yes, quite a bit, which I will probably address over the next few days.
