I believe I understand <a href=\"https://api.guildwars2.com/v2/materials\">https://api.guildwars2.com/v2/materials</a> shows all categories; however there seems to be an absence of exotic crafting materials. As such items like <a href=\"http://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Mirror_(item)\">Mirror</a> seem to not be classified as crafting materials by the API.</p>\n<p>Is there a detail I am simply missing (I wouldn’t put it past em at all), or is this something missing/yet to be implemented?</p>\n<p>Thanks for any insight or answers.</p>","arenanet":false}]}
