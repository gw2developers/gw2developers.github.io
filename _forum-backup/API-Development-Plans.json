We’re thrilled with how quickly you have adopted the APIs and created a huge variety of applications in an equally huge number of languages. Thank you so much for your support.</p>\n<p>—</p>\n<p>I wanted to give you an overview of our future development for the APIs. I hope that this information helps guide our conversations about potential new APIs. The currently released APIs are just the first step towards a much broader spectrum of API support.</p>\n<p>We intentionally don’t have a roadmap for exactly which APIs we will create. Our plan is to use feedback and input from the community to help us choose which specific APIs to make. That said, we do have a longer term schedule that consists of technologies that will make more types of APIs possible.</p>\n<p>We’re working on implementing OAuth2, a safe authentication system that will allow websites and applications to talk to our API on behalf of players without giving those apps your game password. For developers, this will involve signing up for an API key, getting a quota of API calls, etc. For users, there will be a new login flow where they authorize apps to take certain actions on their behalf.</p>\n<p>OAuth2 support will enable many more personalized APIs to be created. Guild, Chat, Character, and other APIs are all possible. We don’t currently have a planned release date for OAuth2, but we’re actively working on implementing it.</p>\n<p>So, when we’re talking about new APIs, keep this division in mind. If we talk about APIs that require authentication, those will need to wait until OAuth2 is ready. We can still talk about them, just keep the requirements for them in mind.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, there are plenty of other unauthenticated APIs we can create now, and we should definitely talk about those!</p>\n<p>Our immediate focus is on supporting the APIs that we just released — that means monitoring the servers, helping developers integrate with our API, improving our documentation, and fixing blocking bugs as quickly as possible.</p>\n<p>At the same time, we’re listening to your suggestions and feedback, and we’re already at work on new APIs. I’m not ready to talk about them just yet, but we’re already working on some of the things you’ve been asking for.</p>\n<p>—</p>\n<p>PS. A suggestion about making suggestions — let’s try this. For each type of API (Guild, Items, etc.), let’s have one thread. Having multiple APIs discussed in one thread is pretty confusing on our forum, and will lead to very long threads that no-one will want to read. And conversely, if we have threads for each idea for an API, it would be too difficult to keep track of all of them. Maybe this will be a good middle ground.</p>","arenanet":true}]}
