A floor is basically an abstract plane along the x/y axes at a specific coordinate on the z-axis.  Your character’s position on the z-axis determines which floor you are currently on, and that determines what is shown when you open the map.  There is a floor-selection control in the bottom right of the map that lets you display floors other than the one you’re on.  The effect is really obvious in Rata Sum and The Grove – the base map texture is different for each floor, and the points <em>not</em> on the displayed floor get faded out.</p>\n<p>A map’s <strong>default_floor</strong> (and a point’s <strong>floor</strong>) is the floor on which it should be shown in full opacity.  A map’s <strong>floors</strong> define when it should be shown at all – this is why story instances share floors with the standard PvE maps, but dungeons and other non-standard maps each get their own floors (and why the continent of Tyria has 64 floors).</p>","arenanet":false},{"pubDate":"2014-07-22T16:19:32.000Z","guid":"http://forum-en.guildwars2.com/forum/community/api/Continent-floors-map-floors-default-floors/4227626","author":"StevenL.3761","body":"\n<p>I don’t really understand the concept of map floors.
