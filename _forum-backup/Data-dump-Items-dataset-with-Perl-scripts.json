(Pipe because comma and semicolon are commonly used within descriptions and I didn’t want to bother with quoting stuff.)</p>\n<p>They’re all in the following folder on GDrive: <a href=\"https://drive.google.com/folderview?id=0B5NobLNMdY89X05tZjZaTUo2X1U&usp=sharing\">https://drive.google.com/folderview?id=0B5NobLNMdY89X05tZjZaTUo2X1U&amp;usp=sharing</a></p>\n<p>Also in there are the Perl scripts I used to dump the data.  I wrote it using Perl 5.16, but it should work down to 5.10 (it uses the smartmatch ~~ operator introduced with that version).  It also requires a couple non-core modules:</p>\n<ul>\n\t<li>JSON::XS</li>\n\t<li>List::MoreUtils</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I know, I know, Perl isn’t really a fashionable language anymore, but it’s the one I like. So there. :P  I plan to work the GW2API.pm module into a full-fledged SDK interface, but I don’t have a lot of free time right now.</p>","arenanet":false}]}
