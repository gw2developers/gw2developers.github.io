(Game modes are: ‘pve’, ‘pvp’, ‘wvw’.) Can also be called with swapped arguments: !gw2 build [ <em>character</em> ] [ <em>game mode</em> ].<br>\n<strong>!gw2 deathcounter/deaths [ <em>character</em> ]</strong> – Toggles a death counter for a specific character and writes its value to ’ <em>/addons/guildwars2/session</em>deaths.txt_ ’ followed by a skull and crossbones symbol ’ ? ‘.  <br>\n<strong>!gw2 goldcounter</strong> – Toggles a gold counter and writes initial gold, earnings plus losses to ’ <em>/addons/guildwars2/session</em>gold.txt_ ’.  <br>\n<strong>!gw2 coinsformat</strong> – Toggles between two different currency formats to display by other functions of this module : ’####.00,00g’ or ‘####g 00s 00c’ (default)<br>\n<strong>!gw2 birthday/bday</strong> – Checks if any of your characters had birthday on the last 3 days.</p>\n<ul>\n\t<li>The slash <strong>/ separates synonyms</strong> to choose from!!</li>\n\t<li>The brackets <strong>[] mark parameters</strong> to input!
