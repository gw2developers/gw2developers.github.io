Now, after <a href=\"http://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Daily/History\">many months of tracking</a>, an exact pattern still has not been found. Even if a pattern were to be found, it could change at any time, and require another several months of research to find again.</p>\n<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>\n<ul>\n\t<li>It would make a nice sidebar for the wiki (just like the <a href=\"http://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Main_Page\">GW1 wiki</a>) and fan/guild websites.</li>\n\t<li>It would allow for nice apps and websites that would see very frequent use.</li>\n\t<li>It would be very light on server processing.</li>\n\t<li>It would alleviate the author of <a href=\"timer.silversunshine.net\">timer.silversunshine.net</a> from having to <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/3f9vv1/world_boss_timer_v5/\">populate the daily world boss manually</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>\n<ul>\n\t<li>Some players may choose to check an app or website instead of logging in.
