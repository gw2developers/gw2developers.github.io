Made a <a href=\"https://github.com/arenanet/api-cdi/issues/160\">tracking issue on Github</a> for this; thanks for the suggestion!</p>","arenanet":true},{"pubDate":"2015-12-29T00:24:50.000Z","guid":"http://forum-en.guildwars2.com/forum/community/api/pvp-rank-points-in-pvp-stats/5885439","author":"sookya.8625","body":"\n<p>Hey Lawton,</p>\n<p>i’ve seen that there is a new value returning in the /pvp/stats-api: pvp_rank_points. I was playing a little bit around and wanted to try out, if i can calculate the “real” rank between first hitting rank 80 and “now”. But the pvp_rank_points value just moves between 1091500 (Rank 79) and 1111500 (Rank 80, +- a small amount of points). Seems that the game just “resets” the rank-points to 1091500 (completed Rank79) when you complete Rank80.</p>\n<p>As a result of this, there is no possibility to calculate the “real” rank (aka: how much times i’ve completed rank 80) or is there another field in your internal data counting how often a person completet rank80? Would love to see that value in the api-result.</p>\n<p>Happy Holidays<br>\nChris</p>","arenanet":false}]}
