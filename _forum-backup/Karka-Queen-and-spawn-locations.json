I am a bit curious though as to what ID corresponds to what location on the map.</p>\n<p>This is what I have so far:<br>\n“E1CC6E63-EFFE-4986-A321-95C89EA58C07”:“Steampipe Steading”<br>\n“4CF7AA6E-4D84-48A6-A3D1-A91B94CCAD56”:“Unknown”<br>\n“5282B66A-126F-4DA4-8E9D-0D9802227B6D”:“Unknown”<br>\n“F479B4CF-2E11-457A-B279-90822511B53B”:“Unknown”</p>\n<p>Could you help me out with the last 3 locations? My server (Desolation) seem to kill Karka Queen very fast so I never get the chance to map the other locations she might spawn at, hehe…</p>\n<p>Thank you!</p>","arenanet":false}]}
