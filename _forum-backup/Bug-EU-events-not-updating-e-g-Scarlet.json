But in the programming world, it’s best practice to seperate your application/classes from dependencies for better code testing and maintainability. E.g. here, you can use static sample data you get from the API once, instead of constantly polling the servers for test data. This ensures you are not dependent on the Guild Wars API servers while running your tests (as they can go offline at some point, they can give unreliable results (like now), there’s no internet connection available, etc.).<br>\nI’m mostly speaking from OOP experience here. I know setting up something like this can be hard, depending on how your environment is set up.
