Is there an API that would give us access to this leaderboards information?</p>\n<p>If not, I have started trying to do this myself by attempting to scrape the leaderboard webpage – but I haven’t been successful due to having to login to the website. I’m trying to write a python script to login and then retrieve the webpage that contains the leaderboard for my guild. I’m using the python library <a>requests</a> to try to achieve this. However, the login is not successful and when I access the leaderboard for my guild it redirects to the general leaderboard.</p>\n<p>Could anyone please help me login to the gw2 website with python-requests?</p>\n<p>Here is my code so far:</p>\n<p>import requests</p>\n<p>EMAIL = ‘my_email’<br>\nPASSWORD = ‘my_pw’<br>\nURL = ‘<a href=\"https://account.guildwars2.com/login\">https://account.guildwars2.com/login</a>’</p>\n<p>session = requests.session()</p>\n<p>login_data = dict(email=EMAIL, password=PASSWORD)<br>\nr = session.post(URL, data=login_data)</p>\n<p>req = session.get(‘<a href=\"https://leaderboards.guildwars2.com/en/na/achievements/guild/Darkhaven%20Elite\">https://leaderboards.guildwars2.com/en/na/achievements/guild/Darkhaven%20Elite</a>’)</p>\n<p>print req.content</p>","arenanet":false}]}
