Since these are (currently) the same for all matches per region, it’s completely useless to add them for each match item – ~1000 bytes of useless overhead – also due to the suboptimal time format which you would parse to a timestamp or a better human readable format in most cases anyway.</p>\n<blockquote><div class=\"citey\"><cite title=\"Posted on February 08 2014 08:48PM\"><a href=\"/forum/community/api/API-Suggestion-World-vs-World/3613050\">blackoil.2673:</a></cite></div><div class=\"quotey\"><p>→ Why EU and NA “objects” have indexed values (“1”: {}, “2”:{}, “3”:{}, …) instead of making them an array?</p>\n<p>→ Each match object has it’s match id, composed by 2 numbers.

You really shouldn’t care about what does it mean</p>\n<p>→ I wouldn’t split the id’s. I would do {\"EU\":{\"1-1\":{…},<a href=\"{...},...}\">1-2</a>,“NA”:{\"2-1\":{…},<a href=\"{...},...}}\">2-2</a>. (or changing 1 by 2, idk which is eu and na…) Id’s can’t be splitted.

I still wonder why Anet chose this format instead of having 2 parameters for the match_details.json like <em>region</em> and <em>tier</em>, both optional so that you could retrieve the match_details for all, a region or a single match if you like. That way it would make the life for database maintainers like millenium.org way easier since you wouldn’t need to loop through the matches.json and call the API 17 times to get the data for all matches.<br>\nAs soon as i saved the gist yesterday, i realized that it would be much better to have the region IDs instead of “EU” and “NA” as identifiers. You may have noticed that it’s currently impossible to access the data for a single matchup or the start and end times for a specific region directly: you have to loop through the whole thing, and check for the match_id since the response is completely unordered. (i have already updated the gist added a regions object which holds the region IDs with the corresponding region to make it a little more descriptive)</p>\n<p>So if you had a JSON like mine, you would just do this:</p>\n<pre><code>var matchData = {...} // the JSON response\n\nvar match = matchData.matches[2][3]; // data for match id 2-3 which is the EU tier 3 matchup\n</code></pre>\n<p>If you still need to loop through the whole thing (or lets say through all matches in a region) you could do this:</p>\n<pre><code>var regionID = 1; // your region id of choice, from a config or wherever you want\n\n// prototype.js\n// http://api.prototypejs.org/language/Hash/prototype/each/\n$H(matchData.matches[regionID]).each(function(match){\n\tconsole.log(regionID+'-'+match.key); // match id\n\tconsole.log(match.value); // match worlds\n\n\t//yada yada yada...\n});\n</code></pre>\n<p>In PHP it could be something like this:</p>\n<pre><code>$json = '{...}'; // get it e.g. via file_get_contents()\n\n// the second parameter for json_decode makes it an associative array \n// i prefer these over objects because of the more handy syntax\n$matchdata = json_decode($json, true); \n\n$match = $matchdata['matches'][2][3]; // EU tier 3 matchup\n\n$regionID = 1;\n\nforeach($matchdata['matches'][$regionID] as $tier =&gt; $worlds){\n\techo $regionID.'-'.$tier;\n\tprint_r($worlds);\n\t\n\t// ...\n}\n</code></pre>","arenanet":false},{"pubDate":"2014-02-08T20:48:10.000Z","guid":"http://forum-en.guildwars2.com/forum/community/api/API-Suggestion-World-vs-World/3613050","author":"blackoil.2673","body":"\n<blockquote><div class=\"citey\"><cite title=\"Posted on February 08 2014 03:21AM\"><a href=\"/forum/community/api/API-Suggestion-World-vs-World/3610535\">smiley.1438:</a></cite></div><div class=\"quotey\"><p>I’ve just had an idea for a more convinient matches.json, shrinked down to ~1/4 of the size of the current response:<br>\n<a href=\"https://gist.github.com/codemasher/8876102\">https://gist.github.com/codemasher/8876102</a></p>\n<p>opinions?</p></div></blockquote>\n<p>I really don’t use the API but I know about API design.<br>\nThis looks good, because the size gets really smaller, but it’s not as self-explanatory as the current.</p>\n<p>What I mean is that I first looked into your idea and there were parts that I didn’t understand:<br>\n-&gt; What’s start and end?<br>\n-&gt; Why EU and NA “objects” have indexed values (“1”: {}, “2”:{}, “3”:{}, …) instead of making them an array?<br>\n-&gt; If i didn’t know about WvW matches (which I do), what does b, g, r mean?

I had thought to request for things like “Life % of Gate/Wall” but realise that it would give too much advantages. Because some strategies includes sending a fake attack to a objective across the map so as to divert attention. Knowing if the “Life % of Gate/Wall” is not going down will effectively void such a strategy.</p>\n<blockquote><div class=\"citey\"><cite title=\"Posted on June 01 2013 08:30PM\"><a href=\"/forum/community/api/API-Suggestion-World-vs-World/2136875\">Tanis.5134:</a></cite></div><div class=\"quotey\"><p>We also currently don’t have a good way of mapping objectives from the API to an actual objective in the world.

Right now these things have to be hardcoded, and that’s pretty lousy. (Though thanks to the people <a href=\"https://forum-en.guildwars2.com/forum/community/api/WvW-objective-names/first#post2076275\">in this thread</a>, we at least have an accurate list for the time being.)</p>\n<p>Another request I’ve seen is giving us the current point value “incomes” of each team alongside the total scores. If we get the point values of each objective this will be less necessary, but it would still be convenient.</p>\n<p>That’s all I’ve got; please add to the thread with your suggestions and requests.</p>","arenanet":false}]}
