However, all the above returns is…<br>\n</p><pre><code>{\n      \"text\": \"API not active\"\n}\n</code></pre><p></p>\n<p>And noted, according to the API documentation…<br>\n</p><pre><code>Key:\n      l : locale aware (via ?lang=&amp;lt;langId&amp;gt;)\n      d : currently disabled  &amp;lt;---------\n      a : requires authentication\n</code></pre><p></p>\n<p><strong>So, just seeking clarification, the feature was tagged “ready” back in Feb 2016, but is still to-date disabled?
