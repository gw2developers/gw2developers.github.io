At the moment it is very tedious to figure out which items are present and which ones have been removed to historical.</p>\n<p>Ideally I would love to see a file/endpoint/thingy which lists when a certain item was added and removed. However I would love to see a simple API endpoint with item name, price,  and availability status. I’m sure more things can be added to it; but even just this would be amazing to have.</p>\n<p>I know I’m coming at this from a wiki standpoint, where keeping those pages up to date at the moment is very very tedious since each item needs to be checked one by one; but I’m certain others would find use for it.</p>\n<p>Darq</p>","arenanet":false}]}
